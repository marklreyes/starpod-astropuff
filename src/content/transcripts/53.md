I am one of three of your hosts tonight at puff provisions mark on Instagram or anywhere else now on Instagram and to my top and my bottom at puff provisions, Mike say what's up, buddy. Muted this one

**Mike:** Hey,

**Darrell:** We got ai. Can you do AI unicorn

**Darrell:** the, I want the head here. I want the head

**Darrell:** uni, my

**Mark:** letting you know, unicorns don't have balls. That's, that's a, that's not a, a unicorn that you're petting. All right. Okay. Yeah. Whoa. It's getting excited.

**Darrell:** Don't

**Mark:** It's

**Darrell:** Don't listen Don't listen

**Mark:** all, all I hear, all I hear is the Trojan Man song. I don't know if you guys hear that in your head. [00:02:00] At any rate, welcome, gentlemen. Good evening. It's

**Mark:** always good to see you. How are you feeling tonight at Puffer Visions, Mike? How you feeling?

**Mike:** I'm alright. I'm feeling good. Smoked a little

**Mark:** That's the spirit. That is the spirit of our podcast or however you want to say it. I hear floating terms like podcast. That's pretty cute and cool. And, And, that's pretty cool.

**Darrell:** Hey,

**Mark:** Since they already took that, I won't, I won't relabel us as that. And at the bottom right there, how you doing, D? Are you high? Are you marginally high or are you sober?

**Mike:** yeah, did you

**Darrell:** Dude, so, I was so I was actually, before I jumped on, I was in the, you know, cleaning up, trying to get the kids ready for bed, and I just lost track of time, and so I actually jumped on sober, and then before we started

**Mike:** Oh, is that why you laughed for a

**Darrell:** I left, like, I know, like, that's the hardest, like, Two minutes of [00:03:00] like, smoking a joint ever, dude.

**Darrell:** Like, like my lungs are hot, dude. My lungs are hot and I can feel like, I can feel it coming up through my face.

**Mark:** Well, I'm two bowls in and I'm feeling I'm,

**Darrell:** It's hitting me hard. It's hitting me

**Mark:** I am, I'm to the, on this, I think it's raining tonight at the time of this recording, so. We here in Southern California aren't really used to that still, even after all this time. That's a different story for a different day.

**Mike:** man.

**Mark:** Gentlemen, it's time to put on your chef's hats. So if you've got one in real life, go ahead and go put it on. If you don't, use your imagination. Tonight, you are going to construct, describe, build, whatever the perfect food. And it's pretty easy. I'm just going to tell you like the parameters and stuff like that. It's not really hard. It's not rocket science. You can have appetizer, entree, [00:04:00] and dessert. And time isn't a limit, complexity isn't a limit, so don't just say like, Oh, a sandwich, because it's easy to make. That's really not what it's about. It's like, give me something of value. An appetizer of value, of meaning to you. Like, that is the shit. And I'm glad that you're high, because I wanted it to be influenced by the munchies just a tiny bit. Or whatever the case may be. A hunger strike in your, in your belly. I don't know. I've certainly got some ideas tonight and in my current state of mind of being high, an appetizer, an entree, a dessert, drinks maybe, you can talk about that, but that's kind of like the little side note. I want to know about those three concise things going on in your current Puff Provisions head when that munchie hits, all right? So, rolling the dice, flipping the coin, it chooses at Puff Provisions, Daryl, you are first. Construct the perfect food. What [00:05:00] is that? It's not like how we were kids growing up in the 80s or 90s when the options were weren't as diverse. We live in, and this planet is now pretty much, it's got different types of menus, you know?

**Darrell:** You know, I'm so used to just, just opening the fridge and just grabbing something. Never really gave me a chance to, I was never given the opportunity to think of like, the craving. Usually I just grab something like. My arm, my hand resonates

**Mark:** but this time you

**Mark:** have, again, it doesn't have to even be about convenience like that. But if it is, then I know where you're going.

**Darrell:** I'm trying to get at is that you've given me food for thought. But I'm now like dude, I want something [00:06:00] different from what you get at, you know, 11 at night. Something elegant, something, you know, Something

**Mike:** like right now, he's, so are you talking about

**Darrell:** like, I want something that you can, that, you know, because at 11 at night, like, I'm not going out, I'm just grabbing for lunch for my

**Mark:** That's

**Mike:** yes, yes.

**Darrell:** I want, I want something more. I want something more. I want like, I want like

**Mark:** I want, I want your Harold and Kumar go to White Castle moment. I want that. I want to access that tonight.

**Darrell:** over the place. Right? But when, when I think appetizer, I think like a nice miso soup.

**Mike:** Okay.

**Darrell:** it's like it's warm. And then it's, it's, it's,

**Mark:** but it's flavorful.

**Darrell:** and then I'm going to do,

**Mark:** Oh my

**Darrell:** flavorful, right? And then it's going to be the good, it's going to be the good miso because it's not the powdery kind.

**Darrell:** It's already like, grounded up nice, so it's like, has a nice consistency [00:07:00] with the, with the hot water.

**Darrell:** And then the tofu,

**Mike:** Good. Good. Tofu. I'm

**Darrell:** good tofu, good, good, good tofu is just a perfect, just one perfectly sliced cube,

**Darrell:** like right in the middle. And then you, and

**Mark:** And that is the best way. I hate the way when you're trying to like, find the tofu. You ever been served those?

**Mark:** Find the tofu miso

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mike:** Little,

**Mark:** like, where was it?

**Darrell:** think, you think you have it? You think you have it, but it's like

**Mark:** what the fuck is this?

**Darrell:** It's like, I, I, I want, I want a fucking

**Mark:** a bed. A

**Mark:** tofu.

**Mark:** bed. Very good. Oh man.

**Mike:** So you're talking about a pillow, a pillow of

**Darrell:** Up, just a

**Mark:** It's in the center of the bowl, right?

**Mark:** And it's just, like

**Darrell:** fluffy, fluffy, in the center of all. And then, like, ever so softly on top, is just some dried seaweed.

**Darrell:** Right on top.

**Mike:** Oh,

**Darrell:** the tofu and, and the top of the

**Mark:** Oh wow, I think that's a hard one to beat, even though it's not a [00:08:00] competition. That is still a

**Mark:** hard one

**Darrell:** something, right? It's, it's like, it's, it's, because miso, you can have miso anywhere, but there's different, the way it's presented, it can be like classy looking miso. You've been to those expensive Japanese restaurants, right? And then you go to like the one down the street here, and you get their canned miso.

**Darrell:** and it and it's like this was microwaved But then you've been to one where it's like dude that old lady made that broth this morning And she's just cutting up the cubes for your for your soup Yeah, it's just been simmering. It's bone

**Mark:** to where it's like, it's super flavorful. I don't know how to describe it, but it, cause they're kind of like they're opposites in the way I describe it, but it's like. A clean soup consistency, but it's kind of also thick just a tiny bit just yeah,

**Mark:** it's, silky.

**Mark:** Thank you Okay, there is there's the word it's

**Darrell:** it's silky,

**Mark:** the soup base is silky. That's when you know, it's like, oh

**Darrell:** So, and that's what, that's [00:09:00] what I was aiming for, is something that's like full on

**Mark:** now you got me mad.

**Darrell:** but doesn't get you, that doesn't get you full. Because there are appetizers where you eat and you're like, oh shit, I don't know if I can take on the entree.

**Mark:** i'm it's unearthing bad experiences even because I love tofu because now the standard is

**Mark:** high when you have when you have a miso soup, but I've had it not

**Mark:** only with just small chunks of tofu where you can't find the tofu but i've also had the ones where like the water and the soy was so separated that That it's like okay.

**Mark:** It's like

**Mark:** there's like a few times where I scoop

**Darrell:** you know what I call that? You know what? You know when you like when it's just like it separates so quickly that you have the you see them. Yeah, you know what?

**Mike:** The miso settles.

**Darrell:** call those sea monkeys. It's just like it looks like a fucking aquarium, right? Like the sea monkeys are

**Mark:** and then when I take a taste, like I take a scoop of it, you can taste where it's

**Darrell:** mm

**Mark:** miso and [00:10:00] soy and all that bean stuff, and then where it's water. It's like, you can just feel

**Mark:** that contrast. At least for me, I'm weird like that.

**Mark:** When I get a spoonful, it's

**Mark:** like, taste the water, then you taste the flavoring.

**Darrell:** or you you get one where it's like that but then like you get the chunk of like the You The flavor powder, like the powder kinda got hard and when you bite into it, then you, then you taste

**Darrell:** the

**Mark:** that's when I'm like, man, I

**Mike:** Explosion.

**Darrell:** Cause they're using shit, they're using shitty paste,

**Mark:** you know, who's actually doing really good food. I, I like it. Trader Joe's has some good those instant ones lately. They've been, they've been

**Mark:** knocking it out of the park with the fried rice. They got some good fried rice.

**Mark:** You might want to

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah,

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** Like, it's

**Darrell:** all sorts, yeah,

**Mark:** of just the orange chicken to compete with Panda, you know. But at any rate, all right, very good. Approvisions Mike. I'm sorry to interrupt good sir, but I want to make sure I want to see if there's any Anything he can do. Is there anything [00:11:00] tantalizing as an appetizer?

**Mike:** mine's, mine's, I

**Mike:** don't think anybody else, I don't think anybody else would like this one,

**Mike:** what I'm doing.

**Mark:** We need we

**Mike:** I don't know. But this is just what, it's popping into my mind right now. For some reason, I'm feeling

**Mike:** fresh. I don't want a salad. I

**Mike:** still want to, you know, so I want cold soba noodles.

**Darrell:** Cold noodles. Cold noodles.

**Mike:** Cold noodles, cold soba, not, not cold, cold,

**Mike:** chilled, like slightly chilled, right? Slightly chilled. I'm, I'm thinking some sort of sesame, I don't know

**Mike:** why, but just in my mind, some sesame, light sesame

**Darrell:** Oil?

**Mike:** oil on it with something else. I don't know exactly what it is, but when I'm, I'm imagining myself eating it, I'm like, okay, this is good. This one might be weird. I don't know if anybody's done it. But that sesame soy sauce type of, not so much soy, but [00:12:00] lighter, maybe a little bit of

**Mark:** Oh yeah, there you go.

**Mike:** vinegar in it. And

**Mike:** then a zest, a lime zest on

**Mark:** I cut up some green onion in that. I

**Mike:** I don't know why I just, I

**Mark:** Cut up some green onion in there.

**Darrell:** That sounds

**Mike:** and, and I want some of that lime zest. So a

**Mike:** little pop. So it

**Mike:** pops.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** sounds

**Mike:** why. So I'm saying it's not for everybody, but just

**Mike:** for right now,

**Mike:** I want that.

**Mark:** a,

**Mike:** Maybe I'm

**Mark:** that's a neutral like palette, like the noodle, especially when it's chilled. And then you just, you customize it with those seasonings. It's like, oh, it's so

**Mark:** good. Damn. Y'all are hitting, y'all are better than mine.

**Darrell:** could be like, you could tweak it a little bit more and add like some fish flakes

**Darrell:** to like compliment that the sesame with the cold, with the soba noodles and then like drizzle it with like a light, [00:13:00] Like a light

**Mark:** Wow. You guys are so eclectic.

**Darrell:** just a little

**Mark:** All right. Since you guys. Since

**Mark:** you.

**Mark:** Since you guys leveled up, y'all leveled

**Mark:** up really nicely already, very classy, I'm gonna pull it back and be a primitive. So, you know, if if you're telling me, yeah, if you're telling me that, I'm gonna go mozzarella steak.

**Darrell:** Kitkat bar

**Mark:** the spirit, in the spirit of this, uh, thematically, that it's a Japanese theme, at least for the appetizer, I don't know about the rest of the menu.

**Darrell:** I don't

**Mark:** no, I want to

**Darrell:** I don't want to Yeah. I

**Mark:** It's not an influence um, because at the end of the day, It probably be fish sticks. Fish sticks are really good right now. Like, oh, but you gotta, you gotta oven bake them. You can't microwave them. You need that crispiness from the, from the

**Mark:** bake.

**Mike:** yeah, for sure.

**Darrell:** damn dude who hurt you who hurt you dude This is a nightmare

**Mark:** soggy fish

**Mark:** sticks,

**Mark:** Oh, oh, no, no, no. Okay. But again, I'm gonna, since you guys went, [00:14:00] you know, you know, that's definitely like, what, two out of four dollar sign, at least on a Yelp review, right? What's the scale?

**Mark:** Four is the highest, right? The dollar sign. it five?

**Darrell:** so This is what I'm gonna have, this is what I'm gonna do for you. I'm gonna take your fish

**Darrell:** sticks.

**Mark:** like three.

**Darrell:** I'm gonna take your fish sticks. I'm gonna do you a favor. Take your fish sticks. I'm gonna lightly brush them with some butter. Then I'm gonna throw them in the, in the, the stove top oven and let them

**Darrell:** like brown

**Darrell:** a little bit. Then I'm gonna take them out so they don't burn because we want

**Mark:** Dang, chef.

**Darrell:** that the butter makes. And then, and we're gonna get some some tartar sauce.

**Mark:** I want, we need lemon, we need lemon,

**Mark:** we need

**Mark:** slices, slices of citrus, like lemon. that too.

**Darrell:** Yeah, it

**Mark:** zest.

**Mark:** there you go. You know, maybe some tartar

**Mark:** sauce too.

**Darrell:** just a

**Mark:** Some of that

**Mark:** I want that tartar sauce too. [00:15:00] Oh, man, you make

**Mark:** oh my god All right, but in the thematically I want to go with this one. This is a good one This is a good one because again fish sticks. That's a good one, too You guys ever maybe this was only my personal problem. I think when I was in hawaii, but you guys ever just get you know, the The pink fish cake that's on the chopping block Like if you go to an asian store, do you

**Mark:** guys just ever eat that just by as is

**Mark:** it's good

**Darrell:** hmm.

**Mark:** as my appetizer

**Darrell:** With

**Darrell:** rice,

**Mark:** no, I just eat it.

**Darrell:** all by itself, all by itself.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mark:** the

**Mark:** fish cake. The fish

**Mark:** cake. And you cut it up into

**Darrell:** the fish, the fish

**Mike:** the ones that you typically.

**Darrell:** Do you, do you cut it or do you

**Darrell:** just take a chunk out of that tube?

**Mark:** the mood strikes. Fifty fifty.

**Darrell:** Oh

**Mike:** Like, do you eat it

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Mike:** do you, do You

**Mark:** You take it out, you

**Mark:** rip it out of its, like, I

**Mike:** un, like un, [00:16:00] like

**Mike:** non non fixed. Like you

**Mike:** don't,

**Mike:** because you could deep, you

**Mike:** could deep fry those too. Or

**Darrell:** No, Mike, I think, I think this man has taken it from the wrapper.

**Mike:** you're basically taking a can of spam and Slicing it and then eating it.

**Mark:** Pretty much. Yeah, it tastes good. There's nothing. I'm still here. hasn't hurt yet.

**Darrell:** know, maybe

**Darrell:** maybe

**Mike:** putting ketchup on it.

**Mark:** again, like, I didn't have

**Mark:** time to get the ketchup, you know, this is probably like a Hawaii problem because it was so hot all the time and I just needed something from the fridge and that's nice and cool, you know, that's it's annoying, you know, that stuff habitually, you'd always find it in like a fridge in Hawaii, you know, like you go to someone's house, you open the door, it's at that butter level, you know, it's in it, there's no butter there, it's the fish cake, you put the fish cake in there, kind of thing.

**Mike:** You know what I was

**Mark:** What?

**Mike:** to mine?

**Mark:** To your

**Mark:** suggestion? Oh.

**Mike:** To [00:17:00] mine,

**Mike:** to my, my soba. I was going to add a, a nice little piece of, sashimi, like

**Mike:** tuna. I was going to put it there. And then Mark comes here with fish cakes.

**Mark:** The good kind.

**Mike:** has

**Darrell:** not, not

**Mike:** a

**Darrell:** even warmed.

**Darrell:** Oh, not even warmed, like he's just

**Darrell:** breathing on it. He's just breathing on it.

**Mark:** Again, I didn't have time. I'm hungry. It's hot. I'm hungry.

**Mike:** Oh, all right. All right. I

**Mike:** mean,

**Mike:** okay.

**Mark:** I mean,

**Mark:** I'm high. All right, I'll puff for visions. Mike, we're gonna move on after the soba noodles are done. Time is not an issue, money is not an issue, or whatever you want to do because of it is convenient and, you know, a great entree. What would that entree be after your chilled soba noodles?

**Mike:** So bright now. I mean, [00:18:00] it's just something that I want. Other if this was another time, maybe I'd want steak and potatoes, right? Some awesome steak

**Mike:** and potatoes, but right now I want to kind of the

**Mike:** opposite. I want, have you

**Mike:** guys been to, what is it called when they serve you sushi? Like the, the sushi chef is in front of you and he makes it in this like a

**Darrell:** beignet, teppanyaki.

**Mike:** No, not, no, no, no, no. Teppanyaki is where they cook.

**Mark:** Oh, okay.

**Mike:** The

**Darrell:** Oh, Sushi.

**Darrell:** Oh, it's like a tasting, right? They bring out like, he

**Darrell:** makes

**Mike:** like 18 court. like

**Darrell:** yeah.

**Mike:** went to one with

**Mike:** Carol

**Mike:** for our anniversary.

**Mark:** Where was this?

**Mike:** Oh my

**Mark:** Is it like a dim sum?

**Mike:** Anyways, I'll find it

**Mike:** while,

**Mike:** uh, no, no, no. no. So you have a sushi

**Mike:** chef right in front of you, right? There's a maximum of like eight people,

**Mark:** So it is kind of teppanyaki style like the showcase the showmanship that's what teppanyaki is

**Mike:** the showmanship of it.

**Mike:** Yeah. [00:19:00] Yeah.

**Darrell:** Is it, Mike, is it is it omakase?

**Mike:** Omakase, So I had Omakase with Carol

**Mike:** and it basically, they make you one piece of sushi

**Mike:** at a time. Right? So like, okay, here, this is the sushi.

**Mike:** Oh,

**Mark:** they

**Mark:** it's

**Mike:** talk to you about it, where

**Mike:** the fish came from and all that

**Mike:** stuff. It's detailed quality is really good, right?

**Mike:** It's not like ordering a roll or anything like that, like three

**Mike:** California rolls and

**Mike:** with crunchies on top. No,

**Mike:** this

**Mike:** is like

**Mark:** is the

**Mark:** cleanest plate of sushi

**Mark:** you'll ever have one at a time

**Mike:** but.

**Darrell:** Nicely

**Mike:** we're having it as an entree and I want it all at

**Mike:** the same time. I want,

**Mark:** the boat.

**Mike:** I want 18, pieces of sushi

**Mark:** a 36, no 18, he wants a 36 piece boat. That's what he wants, he wants

**Mark:** the boat. He wants a 36 piece boat from that guy.

**Mike:** no, no, no. I'm good.

**Darrell:** he wants,

**Mark:** I think you could barrel,

**Mark:** you could barrel through 18.

**Darrell:** It's

**Mark:** one of [00:20:00] us could barrel through 18

**Mike:** You know what? I could,

**Mark:** And you'd still feel your abs.

**Mark:** You're fine. You're gonna get 30s today,

**Mike:** I could,

**Darrell:** called it's

**Mike:** but then We

**Mike:** still have dessert.

**Mark:** oh gosh He's trying to like burden us with mercury poisoning. You know what every time I go to the grocery store and Fresh or frozen it doesn't matter and it has to do with fish There are warning labels on all of them now saying this could have mercury blah blah blah A loss, I guess a loss states that they have to say that to all their products It's like everything is stamped mercury blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

**Mark:** I'm like What's gonna happen when we throw everything in the ocean ocean? You know,

**Mike:** until they start.

**Mark:** I'm gonna eat it.

**Mike:** Stuffing fentanyl in fentanyl

**Mike:** fentanyl right

**Mark:** oh man Damn, that'd be crazy. That'd be crazy weird science

**Mike:** Fentanyl in the fish

**Mark:** That's some crazy weird science right there that could happen so mike's gonna get an 18 piece modestly [00:21:00] an 18 piece

**Mike:** 18 piece modest 18

**Mark:** boat. Yeah. Yeah,

**Mike:** Yes, and I and I regret it if anybody likes sushi And would be okay with fine dining. I think omakase is dope.

**Mark:** There you go. If you're you're if you're in the southern california area specifically i'm gonna guess chula vista. where is it?

**Mark:** You

**Mike:** No, no, no, no, They don't got that here. It's it's a lot of places, but the one that we went to, no, it's not a kid, Omakase

**Mike:** is

**Mike:** the,

**Mike:** that is the style like

**Mike:** teppanyaki or,

**Mark:** man, fun fact. I learned something new tonight. Okay. I thought that was always just reserved for like

**Mark:** the teppanyaki style. Okay. All right. What about you at Puffer Visions, Daryl? We are at the entree after all was said and done with your miso soup with a tofu bed.

**Darrell:** yeah, so it's totally like a total

**Darrell:** pivot and The [00:22:00] the the reason is it's like Mike it stems from Something I've been craving that I haven't had in a while Right because right like right now you have your date you have your regular menu, right? Like for dinner, sometimes you have like, know Chinese and you'll have

**Darrell:** like Filipino foods Yeah, there's a there's a common rotation, right?

**Darrell:** This hasn't stepped into that rotation for for a couple months now You

**Darrell:** Right. And so it's been kind of, you know, eating away at my side. Like, yo, this is something like I would like to have, and I don't know what it is and it's just, it's just a total pivot, mind you, is just, we're going from miso soup,

**Darrell:** like this elegant,

**Mark:** now.

**Darrell:** like pillow of tofu, pillow

**Darrell:** of tofu, with

**Darrell:** You know, right?

**Darrell:** With the, yeah, we're, we're shifting. We're going to shift. We're going to go exit this freeway and [00:23:00] get on another freeway and go the other direction. I want pasta,

**Mike:** like Italian.

**Darrell:** Italian. And because it makes me think of, it makes me think of the pasta I had

**Mark:** which pasta, what

**Darrell:** Um, last year,

**Mark:** to search for?

**Mark:** Which kind?

**Darrell:** the

**Darrell:** bolognese,

**Mark:** you,

**Darrell:** the

**Darrell:** bolognese,

**Mark:** there's like a nice, there's like a nice like thickness to it, but not thick at the same time.

**Darrell:** It's so intimidating when you look at it, you look at it in the dish, right? When it's presented, you're like, dude, I can't finish that.

**Mark:** Was

**Mark:** it in like

**Darrell:** finish that. And then you

**Darrell:** take

**Darrell:** a

**Mark:** in a, red sauce?

**Darrell:** Well, it was

**Darrell:** it was, in a, it

**Darrell:** was like a pink sauce. Yeah. Like a

**Darrell:** pink sauce. I think they put some, yeah, it was a pink sauce. And then the the ground beef, there's like.

**Darrell:** It was like, not so like, overwhelming because some are like, just caked with ground beef and then you [00:24:00] can't even taste the sauce anymore, you just taste the

**Darrell:** ground beef. But like, the noodles, right? This is like a good consistency of like, sauce and ground beef, where like, you don't have to like, chew on bits of ground beef, it's like, that's how fine the bits are, that you can just enjoy.

**Darrell:** It becomes part of the sauce and you can just enjoy the sauce and the noodles without having to worry about like, okay, now I got to chew on the ground beef, like, when's that gonna kick in? It's all,

**Mark:** You know what? I expect all of this being said

**Darrell:** ha

**Mark:** at the next Puff

**Darrell:** ha ha ha

**Mark:** All right, so this better be there. Keep going. I apologize.

And so, and, and then, you know, it's, it's just that, And the way it's presented, right, comes in this like, big ass, like, oblong, like what is it, like a, what shape is that, like a, not a full circle, but like an octa, Like an, I don't know, oblong? I don't know. I don't even know how to describe the fucking plate.

**Darrell:** But you know, it's like that long plate, right? And, and it looks intimidating. Like you see, you see like the pile, like the way like the noodles are on the plate then the sausage is kind of like, like spread across it. And you look at it and you're like, I cannot eat that. Like the bolognese I had when I went to Italy was like that.

**Darrell:** Where I was like, dude, this is a lot of food. I don't know [00:27:00] what happened. I put it away. Like after the first bite, like there was like. Like, like some like angelic music playing in the background. Like I was at the Vatican or some shit. And it's just like, as I ate it, it was just like,

**Mark:** Are, are all these other details surrounding you required for this meal? You need the Vatican and

**Darrell:** It has to be. That's, that's that's the whole thing. I need, I need those.

**Darrell:** I

**Mike:** comes from

**Darrell:** back there. It comes

**Darrell:** yeah, it was it was awesome. Right. It's so it's like. It's hearty, but still not so heavy because you think like the pasta is gonna

**Mark:** Oh, yeah. Do you remember the bread in Italy is like,

**Mark:** is like, it tastes, the quality is so good. It doesn't taste like with

**Mark:** preservatives.

**Darrell:** melted in my

**Darrell:** mouth. [00:28:00] Yeah, there was no I don't think he

**Darrell:** had

**Mark:** or

**Darrell:** they had gluten.

**Mark:** It

**Mark:** doesn't have any of the things that we put here in america. So that's why it's like fresh bread Whatever the heck that

**Mark:** means we're poisoning ourselves with other

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mark:** tastes good. Okay

**Darrell:** I ate so much pasta over there. I didn't

**Mark:** Wow, well, it's probably all

**Darrell:** I did like I did I did

**Darrell:** a bunch of walking too, but I mean my point

**Mark:** Puffer vision

**Mark:** doesn't endorse you just eating pasta and thinking you won't gain weight Public service announcement done. Okay. I'm adding to this potluck. I'm going to, I'm going to not going to, I'm not going to say fish cake again. Don't worry. Just there just in case you want it. However, it is, it has to be the perfect fried chicken. And I

**Mark:** am And I'm talking the perfect fried chicken so gather all the best elements from all of your fried chicken experiences. I want it there. I want like, [00:29:00] you know what, use your hands. Be modest and grab the tongs. It doesn't matter. That's the kind of style I want.

**Mark:** I want a stack

**Darrell:** this

**Mark:** chicken.

**Darrell:** is it? Is it a sauce or a rub?

**Mark:** I would go for the,

**Darrell:** What am I getting myself into? Am I gonna, do I need a napkin?

**Darrell:** Do I need to lick my

**Mark:** the

**Mark:** rub because I want that crispiness. I want that texture. I want the option to choose to dip if I wanted to.

**Darrell:** Just dry.

**Darrell:** Okay.

**Mark:** a really, I want that crunch

**Darrell:** Hmm. What?

**Mark:** Yes,

**Mike:** Question. Do you want thighs, drumsticks, and a drumstick? And a breast all pieces

**Mark:** I would actually, if, if

**Mark:** any,

**Darrell:** looking at here? It's on this

**Mark:** I would actually, I would do drumsticks, yes, because obviously that's the convenient truth. And I would do thighs. No breasts, because I don't want the chance of dry meat, you know? No breasts.

**Mark:** So thighs I want I want that I want that dark

**Mark:** meat. I

**Darrell:** want, do you want juicy,

**Mark:** want guaranteed goodness I want the

**Mark:** I want the

**Darrell:** only?

**Mark:** drumstick for convenience [00:30:00] sake because it's you know

**Mike:** spicy.

**Mark:** i've learned i've learned to like

**Mark:** spicy but either way you can put a spicy rub to it Something in the middle of the thermostat or just you know Just something cross cut with like garlic salt or something like that

**Mike:** Nice crunch to

**Mike:** it. Not too much. Not too

**Mike:** much. Um, do you like a lot of

**Mark:** go on

**Mike:** Go ahead.

**Mark:** But,

**Mike:** good. Good. Good.

**Mark:** oh yeah, it's got to have a lot of flour

**Mark:** and seasoning in it, and I don't want to feel ashamed for knowing how it was fried.

**Mark:** I know it was put through the deep waters,

**Mark:** I know it was dying in there, and it was sizzling. I, I don't feel guilty when I eat it. I want to know, you know?

**Mark:** I don't.

**Darrell:** Gimme. Gimme a flavor. Gimme a

**Mark:** I would, for a dry rub flavor, I would definitely do like a lemon pepper kind of thing. Again, yeah, lemon pepper.

**Mike:** Oh,

**Mike:** we're losing you

**Darrell:** You're losing your sound again?

**Mark:** Lemon pepper. Oh.

**Mark:** Uh

**Mark:** oh. Uh [00:31:00] oh. Is this? Hold on. We're not done yet. a mix. We're not, but I don't want to lose you guys.

**Darrell:** Woah. Oh, you want to mix.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** kind of like, I don't know.

**Darrell:** He made me drop my bolognese, alright?

**Mark:** this is where, this is where it changes. lemon pepper. because it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's weird dry rub like that. And then this is the creative one. I want like a cheetah.

**Mark:** No

**Darrell:** Keep going.

**Mark:** a cheetos flavored Fried chicken

**Darrell:** hmm. Okay,

**Darrell:** better.

**Mark:** it's not enough. It's not enough. Don't lose me here. Don't lose me

**Mike:** Cheeto flavor, golly.

**Mark:** hot if you like flaming hot. It's up to you. It's up to you But just

**Mark:** stay in that family. No other chip option and then the final one. [00:32:00] I don't know if it's even possible But because I said dry instead of wet, I still, I'd want to know if they know how to make like a teriyaki dry rub kind of thing. That's what I would try. How do

**Mark:** you do that? How do you accomplish a teriyaki dry rub? All interesting flavors. And then obviously, I'd want my dipping sauces on the side. You know, I want the option to choose. Okay, blip, blip, blip. So you have, have it all.

**Darrell:** Okay,

**Mark:** Ranch, ketchup,

**Mike:** for

**Mike:** your ranch ketchup, yeah,

**Darrell:** Mike, I need, I need to save him again. You need to save him again. First it was the fish sticks, now it's the fried chicken. You are not invited to the cookout, Mark. Alright? Three flavors, alright?

**Darrell:** at that. He's hungry. He's hungry.

**Mark:** Cool ranch fried chicken. Okay. I always assumed everything had

**Mark:** garlic in it. That's why I don't even think of garlic as an option anymore. Yeah, like I always think

**Mark:** everything's got garlic. So why am I choosing that?

**Mark:** But you are onto something. I am fired because that's a good one. I like the cool ranch.

**Mark:** What if I just did this? It was just [00:34:00] all Frito Lay flavors. You know, like the Sorted. No, here we are, here we are, let's have fun with it. So,

**Mark:** you're right. No,

**Mike:** and cheese coleslaw.

**Mike:** What you doing

**Mark:** Like

**Mike:** fries potato

**Mark:** and cheese for sure and the mac and cheese has to be kind of like it's a rock and a hard place between instant mac and cheese versus getting really bougie about it because if you get too bougie with it Then it's like too cheesy and it's like it sticks together kind of kind of shit You want the

**Mark:** macaroni and

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** feeling still but in an adult way?

**Mark:** So yeah, it can't be too far this way or too, you know

**Mike:** Yeah

**Mark:** but it's got to be that so somewhere in the middle. However, you make that

**Mike:** It's

**Mike:** yeah.

**Mark:** How we make that And then the slaw. For sure the slaw. Not a salad, a slaw. You need a slaw. So the slaw,[00:36:00]

**Mark:** whoever's got the best like knife skills, you gotta make that slaw.

**Mark:** You gotta like pristine cuts.

**Mike:** Oh

**Mark:** razor sliced, right?

**Mark:** Criss

**Mike:** Imagine imagine getting that Getting your drumstick

**Mike:** your, your, your cool ranch drumstick followed up with some nice cool coleslaw.

**Darrell:** it up.

**Mike:** All right.

**Mark:** sounds plain Jane.

**Mike:** back,

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mark:** I invited if I even bring the, but you gotta also still, it sounds kind of boring, but you still gotta bring in the celery to cut, to cut, cut the flavor when you need a break.

**Mike:** Wait,

**Mark:** You

**Mark:** gotta bring celery. Am I kicked out again? Okay, I'll pair it with a ranch dressing.

**Darrell:** You can,

**Mark:** celery with a ranch dressing.

**Darrell:** I'm gonna ask you to wait outside.

**Mark:** Ranch dressing.

**Mike:** leave,

**Mike:** leave

**Darrell:** to wait outside. the chicken wait outside.

**Mark:** I want to come

**Mike:** Yeah, [00:37:00]

**Mark:** party. I'm coming back to this party.

**Mike:** it ain't Buffalo wings. You ain't trying to cut the

**Mark:** That's real.

**Darrell:** back, come back with trash bags because you're cleaning up.

**Mark:** I will. How about this?

**Mike:** you can pick at

**Mark:** Okay, the slaw, all the Frito Lay

**Mark:** profiles, the mac and cheese has to be somewhere in that middle ground where it's not too kiddy, not too bougie, and then finally, you know,

**Mike:** yeah.

**Mark:** one would argue like a doughy, big muffin, right? One would argue for that. No,

**Mark:** not a muffin

**Mark:** biscuit. Excuse me.

**Mark:** Muffin?

**Mike:** a Biscuit?

**Mike:** a biscuit, a

**Darrell:** Biscuit?

**Mark:** though, be creative.

**Darrell:** I said muffin, I was getting ready to throw you back out.

**Mark:** but here this is,

**Mark:** this is where it gets creative. Make the muffin taste like a biscuit, right? And in the middle of it, am I too high on that one? I'm probably too high. Okay. How about this? A big fat [00:38:00] biscuit, A pillow,

**Mark:** biscuits, and steriles on into tofu pillows. I want a pillow too,

**Darrell:** mm mm, mm mm. I don't wanna

**Darrell:** say it.

**Mark:** biscuit

**Darrell:** I'm sorry. No, you know what I

**Mark:** go. Wait, let me,

**Darrell:** Cornbread.

**Mark:** cornbread over a buttery biscuit.

**Darrell:** Get

**Mark:** a butter,

**Darrell:** out. Get out.

**Mark:** like this big.

**Mike:** I'm,

**Mark:** Hmm.

**Mike:** I like both. I

**Mark:** Corn. It's, you don't think the cornbread would be fucking with you in terms of like the Frito Lay profile? Like what if you had, what if you had, which Frito Lay flavor?

**Mike:** I think I'm siding with

**Mark:** the Frito

**Mike:** siding with Mark.

**Darrell:** No, he's

**Darrell:** got a point. Depending on the flavor of Frito Lay, it's gonna

**Mark:** which ones, which ones come in the

**Mark:** box? the barbecue, the Lay's Classic, Cheeto regular, not,

**Mark:** not Flamin Hot.

**Darrell:** sour onion, sour onion

**Mark:** last. [00:39:00]

**Darrell:** Frito Lay Frito what is

**Darrell:** it?

**Mike:** sometimes. Yeah. Those that

**Darrell:** Chili Cheese Chili Cheese Fritos.

**Mark:** okay, you know what? It's still a coin flip, it all depends. Because, okay, so I'll

**Darrell:** that

**Darrell:** depends.

**Mark:** cornbread, okay.

**Darrell:** Well, no, I think I'm gonna take it back. I think biscuits,

**Darrell:** not muffins. Biscuits.

**Mark:** we'll make it a pillow. But it's already convenient for you already. It's fluffy. It's baked, it's warm, and just for fun,

**Mark:** there's a butter, there's a, there's a

**Mark:** disc of butter already melting in there. There's, yeah, of course, and there's a big disc, the disc of butter was wedged in there before it got to you.

**Mark:** And when you open it, it's like half baked. Still at form and then already dripping at the same time. It's like

**Mark:** it's doing its job. And you're like, oh, oh,

**Mike:** Yes.

**Darrell:** yeah.

**Mark:** Real butter too.

**Darrell:** I want to make, a slaw and then I put the slaw

**Darrell:** inside.

**Mark:** done that before, but I bet it tastes

**Mark:** good. You know what? Then it's a chicken sandwich,

**Mark:** right?

**Mark:** Because you assemble it, you put your chicken in there. You could put your [00:40:00] slaw in there, you close it up, and there's a chicken sandwich.

**Mark:** There you go. There we go.

**Mark:** I'm back in the

**Mark:** party. I'm sitting, I'm

**Darrell:** That's,

**Mark:** I know, I know the seat's about to be taken if I don't say anything right.

**Darrell:** that's, that's really good. That's, that's really good. That was really good.

**Mark:** Sweet tooth time. Maybe it's not a sweet tooth. I don't know. Everyone has a different definition of a dessert in different cultures, so I don't know. But now that the Frito Lay fried chicken with all of the dressings on the side and all the sides on the side that we all agreed to, you've got your

**Mark:** Bolognese, Italian style, and we've got the music too for ambiance coming in and out, kind of thing.

**Mark:** And it's a pink sauce, not a red sauce. Mike's 18 piece sushi bowl. You should probably make it 36 since all of us are gonna be there, Mike. So, you know, we're

**Mark:** communally sharing this one together. Alright.

**Mike:** Okay.

**Mike:** Okay. Okay.

**Mark:** of tonight's potluck? At Pup Revisions [00:41:00] Daryl,

**Mike:** ahead. I'll let you

**Mike:** guys go.

**Mark:** Daryl, the coin flip lands on you. We've already chronicled it all,

**Darrell:** Again,

**Mark:** to entree. You're good.

**Darrell:** we're gonna play, we're gonna play on the notion of things I haven't had in a

**Darrell:** long time.

**Mark:** Okay. Okay.

**Darrell:** That, that, that. That my palate craves for. Of, of moist not really, it's not moist. it's,

**Darrell:** it's, uh, I mean, it can't be moist. No, I'm trying to just find the, I'm trying, I'm trying to find the correct word. Bring it all together.

**Darrell:** So what I want Is a slice tres leches cake.

**Mike:** Wait, wait, you went Asian

**Mike:** to Italian.

**Darrell:** I'm

**Darrell:** everywhere, dude. I'm everywhere. And I want, it's the flavor palette

**Darrell:** that I'm after. It's,

**Darrell:** it's,

**Mike:** Tres

**Darrell:** yeah. [00:42:00] Like, I want like the, the milk

**Darrell:** kinda like, the

**Mark:** on the side. Yeah.

**Mike:** Oozing off to the side. Yeah.

**Darrell:** It's uh, yeah, yeah,

**Darrell:** yeah. Like it's wet. Yeah.

**Mark:** is wet on the side. That's when

**Darrell:** it's, it's, it's wet. It's wet. Yeah. It's wet. Yeah. I need to be able to, like, when like I smush, like the last bit of it, there's still

**Darrell:** milk that comes out. That's, that's a, that's a good one.

**Darrell:** That's a good one right there. Right. And it's, it's a weird, it's a weird combination because like, I have, like, bolognese is like super savory, right? I mean, the miso soup is like simple. It's like a light, savory taste. And then. Another savory taste with the bolognese and then now with the dessert.

**Darrell:** I'm like super sweet, right? I mean, but like I like that. I like the flavor of like the cake with the condensed milk

**Mike:** Yeah, that's good.

**Darrell:** Right that that combination and then the way[00:43:00]

**Mark:** is the shit.

**Darrell:** And I don't, I don't chew. When I have, I guess this is like a thing of mine. I don't, no, I, I push it down with my tongue. Like, just like, yeah, right.

**Darrell:** Yeah, and

**Darrell:** then,

**Mike:** and the roof of your mouth

**Darrell:** yeah. And the, the damn thing swallows itself. Like, I don't, my, I just, It goes in and then it

**Darrell:** takes

**Mark:** your mouth, not in your hand kind of mentality. Okay.

**Mark:** Damn.

**Mark:** Wow. It is a good cake, but I've never

**Mark:** known that you would treat it with like that kind of, you have a relationship with that cake, Daryl. what it is. That's

**Darrell:** Yeah, it's it's

**Darrell:** delicious.

**Mike:** How big Is it square? It's square, a square, right?

**Darrell:** Yeah, I'll be a square but I want like

**Darrell:** Probably like the size of like the ones that like Cheesecake Factory, right? I kind of

**Mike:** [00:44:00] like a three by

**Darrell:** like it's Yeah,

**Mark:** still, that's still pretty,

**Darrell:** that's a good that's a good

**Mark:** generous.

**Darrell:** That's a good chunk. It's a good

**Darrell:** chunk. Yeah, it's a good chunk because I don't want to like, I don't want to like Usually like after like you can have too much dessert in my opinion.

**Darrell:** You can have too much dessert where Like something so rich, like, like like one of those, like seven chocolate cakes. You know, like,

**Darrell:** like the seven tier chocolate cake.

**Mike:** seventy chocolate cake or

**Darrell:** I can, I can have like, like one or two spoonfuls of those and I'm done because like,

**Darrell:** I feel like I'm out of like cavity or some, yeah, there's too much sugar.

**Darrell:** Right. That's the thing with Thirst Lunches is you can actually, if I wanted to, I could ask for a second one, right. And that would probably be like good right there, you

**Darrell:** know?

**Mark:** A tres

**Mark:** leches kick.

**Darrell:** it's not too rich, like, yeah, it's not too rich.

**Mark:** had a tres leches kick in forever.

**Darrell:** too

**Mike:** that. I

**Mike:** said

**Mark:** one.[00:45:00]

**Darrell:** Exactly. We haven't

**Mark:** Northgate Market

**Mark:** Northgate

**Mike:** or Northgate Northgate

**Mark:** It's been a minute since I've been to

**Mike:** It's probably trash compared to like really,

**Mike:** really good,

**Darrell:** Like someone who makes this from scratch, right?

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** is good.

**Mark:** And the price is not bad too.

**Darrell:** I think the last one I had was from Goldilocks.

**Mark:** Okay. Cool. Yeah,

**Darrell:** It's not sweet, but it's sweet I mean

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** of contradicts

**Mark:** that sounds bomb.

**Mark:** [00:46:00] That sounds bomb. Cereal milk sounds bomb. Just in

**Mark:** general, to have that as an option for, for this potluck, seriously, that should be like a beverage.

**Mark:** Bye.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** warm, warm

**Mark:** More more cold. Who cares? I don't know. Maybe that sounds mom. Yeah, that that would be the that would be the

**Mark:** drink to bring outside of soda and water to this to this endeavor. All right, I put provisions Mike. What are you going to bring after your 18 piece? Oh, okay.

**Mike:** excuse me. Mine's going to be in theme of the Asian. And it's going to be, there's two parts to it. It's going to be, the first part is like a, a Yuzu sorbet. You guys know what Yuzu is?

**Mike:** Yuzu, YUZU. So it's like a, it's, it's an Asian, it's an Asian

**Mike:** Citrus Asian citrus.

**Mike:** So it's kind of like in between lemon and grapefruit.

**Darrell:** oh

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mark:** [00:47:00] that

**Mike:** It's, yeah,

**Mark:** sounds mom.

**Mike:** it's a little bit more bitter, has a

**Mike:** little bit more of a bite than like a

**Mike:** grapefruit.

**Mark:** say,

**Mike:** Not as sweet.

**Mark:** bite or a tart? Okay, it's more

**Mark:** tart. Okay.

**Mike:** tart. It's

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** more tart. Yeah.

**Mike:** It's a little bit more tart. Yes. That's the proper word. It's a little bit more tart. Because when I've had the, the sushi, some of the sushi is like really like

**Mike:** And

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah. I've had a, you, you surveyed. It's been pretty good.

**Mark:** sounds bomb. Thank you.

**Mike:** I would have the best milk tea [00:48:00] with Boba.

**Mark:** Oh, dude, we found a milk tea with boba kit like a five five in a kit. At like,

**Mark:** uh, I don't know. It was it was like a Those outlet stores like tj maxx or something like that or whatever those like pickups

**Mark:** Yeah, and for like 20 bucks for five of them think about how much one boba boba costs, right? And it

**Mark:** was legit. It was a it was a taro. It was a taro flavored one. And yeah, it was good So it comes with the boba balls and it comes with I don't know how they make this in real life behind the scenes at the boba shops, but for this one it was obviously like a pre mixed powder. And your choice, you could add milk or almond milk or water, however you wanted to do it. And then just boom, mix it all up. And, not bad.

**Darrell:** That actually sounds, that actually sounds

**Darrell:** really good. Milk tea,

**Mark:** when we made it.

**Mike:** I want to yeah,

**Mike:** They're just perfectly,

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mike:** hard. Right? Like

**Mike:** you've

**Mark:** Yeah, dude, that's

**Mike:** a little bit too chewy.

**Mike:** This

**Mark:** probably turned me off from boba.

**Mark:** That's why I don't do it because my first experience with it outside Of I didn't know what boba was and I almost choked Yeah, I almost died.

**Mark:** and like the fact that when you chew it I I was like, why is why

**Mark:** is the jelly all hard like in the center like it was sitting all day It looks that's not supposed to happen. So that's probably

**Darrell:** Yeah. When you don't expect

**Mark:** It's not appetizing.

**Mark:** It's not nice.

**Darrell:** They're like,
