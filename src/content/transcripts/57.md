[00:00:00] What's up everyone? My name is Mark and those two over there, that's Darrell and Mike, two of my like-minded friends who I roped into having adult conversations powered by cannabis. Were simply three dads, husbands, and full-time desktop athletes striving to figure out how recreational cannabis plugs into our modern day world.

Why do vape pens look like USB drives? Should I smoke it or eat it? What would my kids think? We're problem solving our way through this type of mentality on a daily basis, and we decided to capture it in audio. For those of you pondering the same things, but be warned, we speculate a ton and get stuck in God's fridge quite a bit.

You can blame that on the munchies. So if you're comfy with that, come on in, pull up a chair and kick back and welcome to the Puff Provisions podcast.

**Mark:** [00:01:00] Hey everyone and welcome to the final edition this year of the Puff Provisions podcast. I am one of three of your beautiful hosts at Puff Provisions, Mark, sitting there with his Stanley Cup trophy that he just sipped out of. Was that Puff Provisions, Darrell? How cute.

**Darrell:** my parking cone,

**Mark:** Look at that, you're like a, you're a, what's it called?

**Mark:** House husband right there. You're a soccer mom, house husband. You're the house husband. There it is.

**Darrell:** got a couple of these Stanleys just laying around.

**Mark:** We're gonna get to Stanley in just a second, cause that's honestly something I don't understand. I understand Yeti and Thermos.

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** I don't understand.

**Darrell:** I've known Stanley since I was young because my dad had a Stanley.

**Mark:** It's that, it's from that long ago?

**Darrell:** it's a camp, it's a camping product and they got,

**Mark:** Okay,

**Darrell:** repopularize through. The internet's,

**Mark:** see the only Stanley Cup I know, it's Is the one from hockey? You know my ignorance is starting to show really fast at puff provisions. Mike. How you doing, man? Lots of [00:02:00] conversations before tonight a little exhausted a little tired.

**Mike:** Yeah. I was working a little bit. Oh, working a little bit, but I'm all right. I'm here. I'm here.

**Mark:** That's all you need to be. You're in your safe space You're present and you're Working and I'm also relatively don't tease me. I'm still on a CBD. So I'm more relaxed than I am. Hi, but

**Mike:** Wait, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold. Don't, you can't just gloss over this.

**Darrell:** ha

**Mark:** It's one of these one of these What do you mean? I can't gloss over I didn't gloss over it. I just admitted it to you. How is that glossing over it?

**Mike:** no, but you were trying to go past it already.

**Darrell:** Yes, move, you're moving quickly. Ha ha ha ha ha Ha

**Mark:** I'm not moving quickly. I'm fine. I just want, I want to get on with the assignment

**Mike:** Wait, you're still strictly CBD?

**Mark:** up until no tax Tuesday when I get my next ounce. Yes. And I've been on that journey for about journey. Like it's some kind of adventure. No, stupid. This experiment has run its course. So I started it back in September. [00:03:00] I've finally gone through my last cartridge of, of it all. And what I could tell you is this.

**Mark:** Of course, the obvious, you don't get stoned, you're just pretty much mellow and relaxed kind of thing. But what I can tell you is, it was a good experiment, but haven't been in an atmosphere of, I guess what I could say is a creativity, if you will, and that's been lacking just a tiny bit like I'm getting there.

**Mark:** I'm not like, I don't know. I don't know the science of it all to what we need described like levels of atmosphere. I'm at the stratosphere, which is like where the planes are. I want to get over here a little bit, wherever that is, whatever next sphere up as you go up on a rocket ship. If that makes sense

**Mike:** you've been, would you say you've been uninspired for the last 2 months?

**Mark:** uninspired No, I would say that would say that it's just been relatively Boring in my head not uninspired. That's when you say uninspired makes it sound like all depressed and all that and Boring. No, not at [00:04:00] all. Not at all. Just wow, that's it

**Darrell:** Is everything grey?

**Mark:** It kind of like that. It's like a san diego on a may gray Does that make sense like the month of may when?

**Mark:** May gray june gloom You know those weather patterns.

**Mike:** May.

**Mark:** That's what it feels like.

**Mark:** What it feels like.

**Darrell:** You're like the kids. Before the Kool Aid man shows up

**Mark:** Yep. Yep. Yep. I'm pretty much that guy. I'm just like, huh, okay. It's it's not bad. It's not terrible. And it's not good. Does that make sense? But my sleep is great. I don't get the munchies. Again, let's give credit where credit's due here. It's not like I'm scarfing down, getting Midnight munchies or anything like that, so that's a good trade off.

**Darrell:** munchies are bad dude

**Mark:** Yeah, I know.

**Darrell:** lot

**Mike:** I know Darrell and I have been giving you shit for. This CBD thing,

**Mark:** Yes tune into the last episode

**Mike:** I will admit I have reduced my consumption

**Mark:** see and there's a

**Mike:** a lot.

**Mark:** and let's be honest There's like a certain point of like clarity that you can attach to it. I'm not gonna [00:05:00] lie It's but it's a different kind of clarity,

**Mike:** honest, we're

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Mike:** cannabis shills. We're

**Mark:** no. Yeah, that's what i'm saying It's like we know where to use it and when not to use it and honestly

**Darrell:** a tea break

**Mark:** and what a tea break.

**Mark:** Yes You know, I'm getting thirsty again. That's all I can say. Just, yeah, I just, I'm gonna, I'm just letting it chill for a little bit and letting it, letting my whole body stew to the idea. But I'm not in a hurry either. It's just one of those things where, honestly, and I'm not knocking it.

**Mark:** I'm encouraging it like CBD. You've done your job. You did good. Yeah, you calm me down when they needed to, just eased. And I loved it, so it's all good.

**Darrell:** Man, I am so scared for you

**Mark:** Why?

**Darrell:** puff occurs. You're gonna rip your shirt off and Run wild in the streets naked

**Mark:** That means someone sprinkled a little bit of something else on there, and it's not just gonna be what that is. That's sad. Or happy.

**Darrell:** about

**Mike:** was that? What was the last time you smoke weed though? [00:06:00] Recently, right? A couple of weeks ago, something like that. THC?

**Darrell:** THC

**Mark:** Yeah. Then, yeah, okay, yeah, yes. At a recent Palm Springs trip where you could not make it. Yes. And I think that was by way of That was an edible, T? Was it? These were edibles.

**Darrell:** a half ago

**Mark:** Oh, no, it was both. Never mind. It was edibles and flower a month and a half ago, broadly speaking.

**Mark:** For one night, one or, one night only, I think. And,

**Darrell:** time I consumed

**Mark:** yeah.

**Darrell:** I took advantage. I ate everything.

**Mark:** Yeah, and I think

**Darrell:** didn't even smoke. I ate it. Just

**Mark:** I initially ate everything, and then I went to sleep really fast, because that was that. The rocket was to the moon on that one.

**Darrell:** We're we were also drinking.

**Mark:** True, but to Mike's point, it's like, when's the last time you had THC? And I was like, I think we did launch, Darrell. We launched straight to the moon on that one, on that night.

**Darrell:** I was in the clouds,

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** I was

**Mark:** We had our meal, our MRE, our meal ready to eat, Mike, was a Taco Bell. In all various forms and flavors, probably know what happened 12 hours [00:07:00] later.

**Darrell:** I remember one discussion we had was about the sauce. Remember what we were talking about? That, hot sauce for Taco Bell.

**Mark:** Oh, that's right. Like taco bell sauce is only for taco bell, right?

**Darrell:** Yeah. It's only for Taco Bell. They had their food sciences cater it

**Mark:** Yep.

**Darrell:** to their foods. So if you try like the fire sauce on another taco, that's not Taco Bell, it's gonna taste like shit.

**Mark:** Now that is an experiment I have not tried yet. And however, I do encourage it. Why?

**Mike:** can see that. I can see that.

**Mark:** Why? Because it's safe enough. You can try that at home. It's going to probably taste disgusting.

**Darrell:** molecules bonding. It's what it is.

**Mark:** Do you think?

**Darrell:** scientists know what they're

**Mark:** Do you have a preference in terms of Taco Bell hot sauce? You know how there are like three or four different types?

**Darrell:** yeah. I'm, I play around with Fire and Diablo.

**Mark:** Okay, fire the elbow. Okay, so because we live in SD and we know it's where the best Mexican food is,

**Mike:** Hell yeah.

**Mark:** nobody gonna challenge me on that, alright?

**Darrell:** Yup.

**Mike:** I dare them[00:08:00]

**Mark:** Exactly. Exactly. Let it be known, people. I don't care if you're in LA or Texas.

**Mike:** cities

**Mark:** food?

**Mike:** the

**Mark:** Mexicans across the border are like, No, c'mon guys, the best Mexican food's over here.

**Mark:** Yeah, we're not counting them.

**Darrell:** outside of that

**Mark:** not counting them, we're counting Ri. Yeah, we're counting

**Mike:** photographing

**Mark:** side of the border. We're counting that. That it's always gonna be SD. Now, that being said, back before I go into a tangent. Do you think any one of those Taco Bell sauces would pair well with SD's Mexican food?

**Mark:** You mean, if I put Diablo or Fire on a Cali burrito, it wouldn't work? Yeah, I'm not

**Darrell:** were made in a lab and

**Mark:** I'm not challenging that. I'm just trying to see if we paired the two.

**Darrell:** the hot sauce that we get from any Mexican restaurant here. Is made fresh. There's some old lady

**Mark:** Yes. That's true. Whether it be the red one or the green one, you're right. One, you're right.

**Darrell:** making, that's from scratch and that's, there's no substitute for that.

**Mike:** like, I love ketchup on a lot of things,

**Mark:** I've been getting petitioned [00:09:00] a lot and pitched, sales pitched a lot by the Puff Provisions Wi Fi and using Ketchup on everything. She's an ambassador for it. On it? Even on Mexican

**Mike:** No, would not use ketchup on a steak

**Mark:** There are people that do, there are people that do that.

**Mike:** Taco Bell hot.

**Darrell:** I'm glad you don't, Mike.

**Mark:** Yeah, that's a, by the way, that's a sin. I'm not condoning that.

**Darrell:** ask you to lose my number just immediately.

**Mike:** about like a good steak, right? A good

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** to a night, a good

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** deep,

**Mike:** look at

**Mike:** Bell hot sauce. amazing.

**Mark:** wait,

**Mike:** put it on other stuff, right? You could put it on other stuff. It'd probably be good too.

**Mark:** do you,

**Mike:** not letting it touch my, my Cali burrito.

**Mark:** true that,

**Darrell:** It belongs there, right?

**Mark:** do you think,

**Darrell:** belong, it belongs there. It doesn't

**Mark:** it's like seats taken, right? Seats taken.

**Darrell:** Has no business around my Cali burrito.

**Mark:** Okay, but let's go with junk food style stuff, or fast food style. Taco Bell is obviously the example. What if we use their sauce on, Competitors product like, like Del Taco or I can't even remember what Del Taco tastes like, their [00:10:00] novelty.

**Mark:** I don't even remember. No,

**Mike:** I don't

**Mark:** it's not memorable.

**Darrell:** only had Del Taco on one instance

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** I Regretted it instantly.

**Mark:** I went to the bathroom instantly.

**Darrell:** Like I didn't know what I was eating. What am I putting in my mouth?

**Mark:** I think they have a potato taco or something. They sell hamburgers too.

**Darrell:** and I they

**Mark:** Fire call. I don't know.

**Darrell:** Mexican cuisine,

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** I get that but You the flavor of it was just so weird.

**Mike:** start

**Darrell:** story are you trying to tell me?

**Mike:** I'll

**Mark:** this is true.

**Mike:** back

**Mark:** what we've learned, what we've landed on is don't F with my steak. And a good steak is a good steak.

**Mark:** SD's got the best Mexican food. Cha ching! And we never, ever let it touch Taco Bell sauce, got it. Got it.

**Darrell:** a quick tangent and just the opposite of that for me is nuggets at any sauce, doesn't matter. McDonald's, Chick fil A,

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** pairs

**Mark:** Does it [00:11:00] matter what kind of chicken nugget you get? Does it have to be the ones from McDonald's or if it's a Dino nugget from Costco?

**Darrell:** I've tried chicken McNuggets. I've tried

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** Silence.

**Darrell:** interchanged sauces because we keep the sauce. You get extra sauce, you keep it in the fridge.

**Darrell:** Sometimes, even Nuggets. Dino Nuggets. Any sauce in the, in, from whatever restaurant.

**Darrell:** It works for me. That's from just my opinion and from my experience. There's not one bad sauce from, specific restaurant that doesn't pair well with any of the nuggets.

**Mark:** Yeah. What do you think? Go for it. Here

**Mike:** I was going to say, I was going to, I agree, Darrell, that it's your opinion. I

**Mark:** Notice how he sets the stage. I

**Mike:** agree. It's

**Mark:** with you that it's your opinion.

**Mike:** opinion, whatever you do in your household, I don't care, whatever you teach your children, I don't

**Mark:** This is what divides [00:12:00] nations.

**Mike:** in my household, Darrell, in my house,

**Mark:** Oh, man, you're gonna get it. Oh, man

**Mike:** if I see you have that Wendy's chicken nugget and you're dipping it into some McDonald's sweet and

**Mark:** crisscross

**Mike:** Oh,

**Darrell:** I'm being asked to leave. Please go home.

**Mike:** the hell out. Get the

**Darrell:** Get out of my

**Mark:** I think I found I think I might find a little bit of middle ground in both of your use cases What but what if I told you I agree with Mike I agree with you Mike and I agree with you Darrell however Through my journey of being you know in the presence of munchies Opening up god's fridge on a daily basis things like that we used to do back in the day You What I've landed on is this.

**Mark:** Chic fil a sauce, specifically, is very interchangeable with any kind of chicken.

**Mike:** I agree.

**Mark:** Okay, hear

**Darrell:** I agree.

**Mark:** me out. It's, yeah, it's a chicken nugget like you guys said here, or a dino nugget. But even just those, supposedly 5 rotisserie chickens? Or, they're not 5 anymore in an inflated world, [00:13:00] like 6 7

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** Like six, seven 99 at Walmart

**Mark:** Except for Costco. Costco will beat anybody's price on that. They're still gonna Chick fil a sauce pairs well.

**Mark:** That's all I'm gonna say.

**Mike:** Yeah, I think, I do think Chick fil A sauce is rather neutral enough, regardless of nuggets, salt content or the ridges, I'm getting,

**Mark:** Ridges.

**Mike:** man.

**Mark:** Which,

**Mike:** are you know what I'm talking about? The ridges, the way it's designed, the, the, the coating on the, the breading on the nugget, that matters to me, in my opinion, Darrell.

**Mark:** here we go with the, In my opinion, Something's happening.

**Darrell:** was a thing. Really?

**Mark:** It says,

**Mike:** to ask you a question then,

**Mark:** Yes. Yes.

**Mike:** eat your nugget, you dip your nugget, do you put the whole thing in your mouth? Or do you take a bite? Mark,

**Darrell:** It's not sushi.

**Mark:** I think I just got kicked,

**Mike:** there?

**Mark:** I just got kicked out of Mike's house.

**Mike:** Did you pop the whole thing in your mouth?

**Mark:** I'm thinking, give me, just be quiet. Give me a second.

**Darrell:** it. Like,

**Mark:** Uh, [00:14:00] is that a bad, is that a bad habit?

**Mike:** No.

**Mark:** You guys seem like I alienated you guys.

**Mike:** I just want to know who the fat boy is in the group.

**Mark:** Oh me, come on. It's me. It's totally me. It's, the nuggets aren't even like grand in size. They're like, they're bite size. They're finger foods, guys.

**Darrell:** One thing you

**Mark:** finger foods.

**Darrell:** Mike, it's, what else can I fit in there?

**Mark:** Unorthodox, however not inaccurate. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. Let's get it.

**Mike:** you pop them in. All right, popper. You're a popper.

**Mark:** And I like to look you in the eye while I do it.

**Mark:** Since we're getting into unorthodox things, I wanted to celebrate Happy Highlidays to the two of you and everyone else listening in this dot com and post AI world.

**Darrell:** Wait, did you say Highlidays?

**Mike:** Like Yeah, getting high. Happy Highlidays.

**Darrell:** I see where you're going.

**Mark:** Yeah, I'm going to get a little unorthodox.

**Mike:** Darrell.

**Darrell:** I, I'm picking up what you're putting down. Gotcha.

**Mark:** It's the last one of the year. We're going to celebrate in different mental models and mental [00:15:00] flows. It's going to get unorthodox. You're drinking out of your hockey championship cup there, so I'm glad you're comfortable. This is good. Tonight, we're gonna celebrate both Thanksgiving and Christmas in a very unorthodox form.

**Mark:** That during the holiday season, things start to change and a little few unique things start to occur. Especially Thanksgiving,

**Mike:** provided

**Mark:** old meal. Cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, stuffing, et cetera, et cetera. Classics. Christmas time.

**Mark:** Gift of the year. Whatever's been trending or whatever you like in your heart of hearts where it's just amazing that you got it. You

**Mike:** [00:16:00] Okay.

**Mark:** is the dish you're bringing?

**Mike:** we're

**Mark:** going to let that settle for a few short minutes

**Mike:** different

**Mark:** want to paint the picture as it's got to be unorthodox.

**Mark:** I didn't say weird by the way. I didn't say like

**Mike:** close

**Mark:** hot dog and peanut butter and jelly.

**Mike:** any

**Mark:** I'm not encouraging that by the way. I might taste good though.

**Mike:** Student

**Mark:** How high am I? I don't know,

**Mike:** this time,

**Mike:** will

**Mark:** me a little something. Give me a little something.

**Mike:** the board

**Mark:** Give me a little culture, if you will. Give me a education, something.

**Mark:** Give me something outside of the normal wheelhouse for what you're going to get out of the Boston market menu. Know what I mean? Is that hard?

**Mark:** Is hard.

**Mike:** it's a potluck.

**Mark:** It's a potluck.

**Mike:** We're going to Mark's house.

**Mark:** And it's the classics are gonna be there. The classics will be there.

**Mike:** are already going to be there. So classics are being provided

**Mark:** And likewise,

**Mark:** when I set the stage for Christmas, it's classic. It's a classic Christmas tree. Not the novel. The songs are the same. The people and the [00:17:00] sweaters are as ugly. But we'll get to that holiday in a second. But right now, we're gonna head into Thanksgiving tomorrow on Thursday. What are we bringing?

**Mark:** You wanted to be different this year, I guess you could say. You wanted to be special. What is it? What is the food network inside of you? What does the Bobby Flay in the side of you say

**Mike:** and,

**Mark:** It's fucking hard I just realized

**Mark:** that's why I only want one dish because this is already hard.

**Darrell:** Yeah, that's

**Mike:** you're not high, I'm not high right now, unfortunately.

**Mark:** Okay. This is a

**Mike:** it does takes a little, it, if I was high, boom, I'm already craving, like I got these, I got Red Vines right now

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** I probably would be thinking of Red Vine, candy, yams, who knows?

**Darrell:** Ha

**Mike:** I'm not high, so it's gonna take a little bit, a longer creativity,

**Mark:** How the heck do you melt a can how do you make that into a candy? Yeah, we're gonna have to Google that one later That's a good one.

**Mike:** [00:18:00] so unconventional food now, mind you, we all probably have different households where, we are brown,

**Mark:** Last time I checked.

**Darrell:** ha! Hah! Yeah.

**Mike:** we come from, Asian island nation where sometimes we have already unorthodox foods

**Mark:** That's true.

**Mike:** table.

**Mark:** That's true. That's true. When was the last time? Actually no. It's been a long time, but if I ever see a pig cut up in 10 million different ways, I'm not scared of it. That's one way to, that's one way to describe it. That's true. Sorry. Sorry to all our vegan friends out there, but tough shit.

**Mark:** That's the truth.

**Darrell:** Save me some skin.

**Mark:** Exactly. Okay, so then I think I'm going to channel a little bit of your route, but I'm not going to copy you. I would like to do, s'mores sweet potato pie, if that's possible. Does that make sense, or does that make you sound like you're going to throw up in your mouth?

**Mike:** That's gross.

**Darrell:** Makes my teeth hurt.

**Mark:** Why? What part of that makes you,

**Darrell:** sweet. Too sweet.

**Mike:** doesn't like too sweet. Yeah.

**Darrell:** I don't like too sweet.

**Mark:** Okay, so did I [00:19:00] offend you? Because you

**Darrell:** I'm gonna be the guy you see with the plate and the trashcan. Bottom up. Cause I don't want to offend

**Mark:** to offend anyone

**Darrell:** It's bottom up. All

**Mark:** Wow That's like you guys are fresh off of voting or something that you don't want to offend anyone right now and take a political stance Huh? No, we'll save that one for next time. I see here's the thing I don't want to go with like I want to wrap bacon over everything I feel like that's a cop out

**Darrell:** Go

**Mike:** I have

**Mark:** because I could wrap bacon on anything and i'm just like, okay, that's it But no, I want to transcend and go beyond Bacon wrapped So, Mike, you're scaring me.

**Mark:** What do you got?

**Darrell:** Mike. Go Mike.

**Mike:** I'm thinking, I Thanksgiving themed.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** Because a lot of the times, a lot of the stuff that you eat for Thanksgiving has elements of sweetness in it, right? Cranberry sauce, you got your yams, candy yams or sweet potatoes, right? [00:20:00] Or, and then you got your turkey. So I don't know exactly how, what combinations I'm throwing in there, I feel like you, you can get some ice cream.

**Mark:** This has a Willy Wonka vibe to it. This has an exact,

**Mark:** is when, this is exactly when a Violet gets greedy and starts chewing on everything. And she turns into a blueberry, right?

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** Exactly.

**Mark:** the main course, the appetizer, main course, then the dessert, which is the blueberry pie comes up and then she bursts into, she almost bursts into, into a over plump blueberry.

**Mark:** What would it be then? Let's channel it. Are you trying to get really crazy with it and do the exact same effect like the ice cream serves as the appetizer then gives out the, gives out, oh my

**Mike:** exactly what I'm thinking, bro.

**Mark:** Oh, but the medium being used is ice cream.

**Mike:** so if we're doing, if we're doing something, it would be a light, it wouldn't be like a full, like big on scoop or anything like that.

**Mark:** That's fine.

**Mike:** about little taster

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** cream.

**Mark:** Okay. [00:21:00] Okay.

**Mike:** maybe again, I don't know exactly what the combination or the flavor profile will be, or the ingredients, but once you get that cold ice cream in your mouth, you're like. Thanksgiving

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** and I'm

**Mark:** okay.

**Mike:** ready for the mashed potatoes,

**Mark:** Okay. Okay.

**Mike:** but it has the, I

**Mike:** I have

**Darrell:** you know what reminds me of Thanksgiving? That dessert, dessert flavor desert. Ha. D, dessert flavor. And you're aiming for it right now Mike. Is some sort of apple pie,

**Mark:** Put it on an apple pie, right? Alamo ed style?

**Darrell:** A la caramello

**Mark:** Ooh.

**Darrell:** that's not

**Mark:** And that's not too sweet for you?

**Darrell:** that's not too sweet for

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** is sweet.

**Darrell:** It's not. I can do, I can dig that.

**Mark:** Okay. Okay. Alright. I guess I'm getting hypocritical because it's in, in lieu of a bacon wrapped anything, but technically not. This is rather weird what I'm thinking in my head right now, but I'm going to run with it anyway. Okay. Mike, I accept. Well done. Bravo. Let's take the [00:22:00] ice cream.

**Mark:** Let's take the ice cream. No, because we gotta get to Christmas, guys. We're gonna get to Christmas after this. What do you guys think? Since today, to inspire off of our Asian Islander vibes and the influences of all of those multiple cultures. Let's go with Lechon. Will save you the skin, D. You're welcome.

**Mike:** skin.

**Mark:** it looks like a

**Mike:** What's

**Mark:** pig.

**Mike:** for our

**Mark:** Oh,

**Mike:** that aren't of Filipino descent,

**Mark:** so it is essentially how do I say this Darrell? It's like a charbroiled roasted pig.

**Mark:** Pretty much slow roasted over many hours.

**Darrell:** kissed.

**Mark:** It's The whole freaking body of it is stuck on a spindle and slow roasted if you could until that skin turns into a potato chip.

**Mark:** It's so good once they hit.

**Mike:** crispy.

**Mark:** Oh, yes It's a

**Darrell:** crispy

**Mark:** rather golden if you do it, too What'd you say, that

**Mike:** when you slice into the meat, it is, [00:23:00] and

**Mark:** not an ounce of regret.

**Darrell:** My uncle would cut it.

**Mark:** The whole pig. There is no part of the pig that is left behind.

**Darrell:** That sucker is yours.

**Mark:** It's basically the best way you could have put Porky the pig down.

**Darrell:** Your uncle,

**Mark:** is the most honorable way.

**Darrell:** cuts a slice over the fire while it's still going just to see how good it is.

**Mark:** Ugh,

**Darrell:** And you see the juice, drip out and go into

**Mark:** Talk dirty to me. That's what I'm talking about. Huh.

**Mark:** Like that. Oh my gosh, so classic, Mark. It's so basic. If you went to a Filipino Thanksgiving, that might even be there, right? But,

**Mike:** probably be there. It

**Mark:** My little hybrid to it is

**Mike:** do that.

**Mark:** And

**Mike:** we

**Mark:** to be inspired by, our Thanksgiving turkey meal,

**Mike:** going

**Mark:** is it possible to stuff that with, stuffing?

**Mike:** are going to go to

**Darrell:** Yes.

**Mike:** and

**Mark:** Stuff a lechon with stuffing.

**Mike:** we

**Mark:** In some way, shape, or form.

**Mike:** to file.

**Darrell:** yeah, it's not your, it's not your normal stuffing. I've seen that.

**Mark:** Oh yeah?

**Mark:** Yes

**Darrell:** delicious.

**Mark:** but what I could, but to stay in [00:24:00] tune to Thanksgiving, I do want it to look like that. But I want it to not have a A nasty flavor, if you will. It's got to pair well, if you will. So I want to like the stuffing has got to be, inspired by a lot of carbohydrates.

**Mark:** So I do want to like use like a bread and whatnot. And like some kind of cross cut vegetable, if you will, like a celery, but I have a feeling without ever experimenting with it on my own. That it could be done. Do I get accepted to go to this party? Do I get accepted to the potluck at my own house?

**Mark:** You're like, fine. We need someone to clean up anyway.

**Darrell:** I want that pig, so yes. ha.

**Mike:** in it.

**Darrell:** Yeah, I'm just gonna pick it out and put it in the trash anyway. I just want the skin.

**Mark:** Paper plate down on the trash can.

**Darrell:** play it

**Mark:** Oh my God.

**Mark:** Let's not offend anyone. Yeah. Feels like some people voted today. All right.

**Mike:** Just to make sure

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Mike:** I'm understanding, so you would get the stuffing that you would normally put in a Turkey, the same, but the same exact stuffing that you would recipe.

**Mark:** I would,

**Mike:** That you

**Mark:** yeah, loosely inspired. Yeah.

**Mike:** and then you would put that [00:25:00] stuffing into a lechon

**Mark:** Oh yeah.

**Mike:** roasted

**Mark:** Into a roasted pig and it would still have to be cooked in that technique of slow roasted on the spindle until that thing is caramelized down to the teeth. So everything just like starts to coagulate together and cook together and steam together and get tender together. Yeah,

**Mark:** I,

**Mark:** That sounds like it's gonna give you the burps, or give you the farts. I don't care. That's not my problem. My problem is, I need to see if I can do this. And,

**Mike:** My only

**Mark:** you have a concern? Oh gosh. A

**Mike:** only concern is pig is a lot fattier than,

**Mark:** bird? Yeah.

**Darrell:** A bird.

**Mike:** and I know turkey can be fatty too, right? There's a lot of fat that comes off of it.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mike:** Concern is there's a lot of fat in a pig, and that might just be all fat that you're queuing up because this is good.

**Mike:** That bread is going to soak. All of it is going to soak all of it. It might be born [00:26:00] gelatinous

**Mark:** I am not a culinary expert. I really wish I was. I wonder if there's anything that I could use to block all of that fat.

**Darrell:** Plastic bag? I don't know why

**Mark:** But then you cook the plastic bag,

**Mike:** I've never roasted a pig, so I don't know how many, but I'm just bread and

**Mark:** bread and pig fat. Yeah. What I, what's I need a chemist. I need something that cross cuts against that fat. I'm gonna have to come back with you on that.

**Darrell:** you know what you use? You don't use bread.

**Mark:** Give me a carb

**Darrell:** use a, no, use

**Mark:** rice

**Darrell:** like ground beef.

**Darrell:** That's what it is. So you take ground beef, you mix it with veggies, and you stuff it in the pig. And so the fat trickles down onto the ground beef

**Mark:** you're hired when I throw that plate in it's gonna be played up.

**Darrell:** You gotta cook it over the fire. Then you get your ground beef with your veggies. You stuff it, then you gotta it

**Mark:** Instead of ground beef, would you use ground pork or is that too meta?

**Darrell:** could use ground pork. I think ground beef kind of complements it.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** I think, what is it? I'm, what is that?

**Mark:** All right. All right. All right. All [00:27:00] right.

**Mike:** down,

**Darrell:** they're picking up

**Mark:** I'm picking up what you're putting down. All right.

**Mike:** up what you're putting

**Mark:** All right, you got me excited again. I like it. I like it All right, so we got our

**Mike:** Stuffing. Stuffing, yes. Yes.

**Darrell:** Stuffing

**Mark:** We'll fix the stuffing. So we're getting there. So okay, you know what? We're two out of the three in. All right, we got the interchangeable flavored ice cream from Mike.

**Mark:** We've got

**Mark:** stuffed lechon, stuffed roasted pig for all of my non Filipino friends out there. We need one more D. Do you have anything or should we move forward?

**Darrell:** I have I want to speak from experience

**Mark:** Oh gosh, is it a good experience? Please say it's good.

**Darrell:** a good experience. it depends on which side you're on.

**Mark:** Oh, so vegans, please put on your earmuffs.

**Darrell:** More of, the lighter color skin. Let's just say that.

**Mark:** Okay. Okay.

**Darrell:** I've, so at a,

**Mark:** The conventional.

**Darrell:** Regular, traditional Thanksgiving, right? Turkey, you got your, yams,

**Darrell:** your stuffing, all that, right?

**Mike:** [00:28:00] Yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Darrell:** Now

**Mark:** It's gorgeous. It's beautiful.

**Darrell:** To the left of the beautiful turkey that's stuffed with this wonderful stuffing,

**Mark:** Okay. Yeah.

**Darrell:** And not just not like delightfully cut, like it's the fucking whole fish. Like they cooked it on the thing and it's done, wrapped it in the foil and shit.

**Darrell:** Next to the turkey. And it's looking right at you.

**Mark:** And it's body is bent because

**Darrell:** a

**Mark:** the heat

**Darrell:** side is

**Mark:** curled the body.

**Mark:** That's when I know I'm like, there's some, there's an Asian here. There's an Asian in this house. I look around, I'm like, who is it? If it's not me, it's somebody else. Who did that? Who did that? Who did that? Just the asians It was just

**Darrell:** right here [00:29:00] is the only people who enjoyed

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** actually really good.

**Mike:** and

**Mark:** Yeah, that's true.

**Darrell:** brave one. There was a brave person that did try it.

**Mike:** by. Okay.

**Darrell:** they didn't know how to navigate the bones,

**Mike:** All

**Mark:** What's really gangsta

**Darrell:** You get points for trying it.

**Mark:** You know what's really gangsta? Is if you go all in, because you know that there are some of our elders out there that will go all in on that fish and eat its face right in front of you two.

**Darrell:** they will eat.

**Mark:** and all.

**Darrell:** Yes.

**Mark:** Spoon and fork. Exactly. Spoon and fork.

**Darrell:** And usually once that starts, that's usually when everyone clears

**Mark:** that's,

**Darrell:** They wait till they're the only one left at the table. And they're like, Oh, eat your face.

**Mark:** that is a serious fish, that is a serious fish connoisseur, that will. That will take it down.

**Darrell:** there is they do it, they do stabbing.

**Mark:** Yes,

**Darrell:** It's nicely cut. There's like the mayo and the garnish on

**Mark:** although we're not talking like that. Are we're not talking like that. We're talking about the whole fish

**Darrell:** I don't even know what kind of fish it is. It's like a fish from Asia, right?

**Darrell:** Like

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** big white fish, big ass eyes looking right at you [00:30:00] like eat me.

**Mark:** And like you think it Unlike other garnishes out there that are purely like for look and decorative and stuff Maybe it has an effect to it. You're just randomly throwing like a vegetable attached to it like this

**Mark:** just about let's give it effectiveness. It's all about effectiveness.

**Darrell:** efficiency. You want that? You just chopped up the celery yourself and you grab the lemon and you just spray it

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah. Happy Thanksgiving.

**Darrell:** that, we're going to go work out in the field when we're

**Mark:** We gotta go set the rice patties up, motherfuckers. That's what it is.

**Darrell:** Yep, exactly. Bringing that. I'm bringing that. At least I know I'm eating.

**Mark:** I

**Darrell:** Maybe

**Mark:** think Darrell, Darrell is already assuming just because like we're like more familiar with that palette that we still wouldn't be offended by that idea.

**Darrell:** In terms of unorthodox, that's what we're

**Mark:** Yeah, and I'm pushing that. I wanted to push the boundaries on unorthodox right there, like mildly weird, borderline cliff hang cliffhanger. Weird, no, nothing out there.

**Darrell:** can get past, don't judge a book by its cover.

**Darrell:** Good. It was[00:31:00]

**Mark:** can I ask the guest that act, the non Filipino guest that ate it though, like you said, oh, this guy was brave. Oh, the host was brave.

**Darrell:** She was brave

**Mark:** At what part of the fish did she eat?

**Darrell:** Oh, we had to set her up.

**Mark:** Oh, see,

**Darrell:** her go

**Mark:** I knew, fuck,

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** you pick out

**Mark:** because I could already tell,

**Darrell:** can't let,

**Mark:** I could already

**Darrell:** hose. You

**Mark:** error was going to happen. Yeah. Yeah, she will.

**Mark:** Okay. All right. All right.

**Darrell:** So we

**Mark:** Cool.

**Darrell:** her up, we set her

**Mark:** Yeah, because I was thinking she navigated that thing on her own and she fucked

**Darrell:** you

**Mark:** up.

**Darrell:** do that.

**Darrell:** You only do that if you wanna get entertained. You take the dude and you go, Hey, some fish. And then you just watch him struggle.

**Mark:** That's a quick, accelerated way to say cheers, friends. Cheers to the team. Happy Thanksgiving. Tonight, we've had a fish carcass essentially looking at you with one celery beanstalk slapped to its body, squirted with a little bit of lemon. Mike, I really like your novel idea of ice cream.

**Mark:** I like it. I like it. Some kind of yielding [00:32:00] those Thanksgiving notes, if you will. I like that.

**Mark:** What you got going on there? Is that a, that's a trick or treat candy? What is it? Spill the beans.

**Darrell:** Dad Tax,

**Mark:** Nice.

**Darrell:** through the kids candy.

**Mark:** I've been going through peanut butter cups like crazy.

**Darrell:** I just got one right here.

**Mark:** And we will do the roasted pig, the lechon, with ground beef stuffing.

**Mark:** And we'll do it that way. I'm into that. Mike is

**Darrell:** Okay, let's flip it,

**Mark:** right now. He had to.

**Darrell:** let's flip it on its head though, right?

**Mark:** Why? It's already been flipped on his head.

**Darrell:** no, instead of, would you like to see on the table? When you go to someone's house, you're invited for

**Mark:** That's an easy one.

**Darrell:** that you have in your mind? Oh, I know this, I'm hoping this is here. this dish is going to be here. I hope this is here. Because if it's here, it's on. It's not always turkey for me. It's not always turkey.

**Mark:** Mike already hit it right there is a like going into sweet potato candy. Yeah, I'm area [00:33:00] Yeah

**Mark:** surprisingly

**Darrell:** if I go to a

**Mark:** Like welcoming to me

**Darrell:** table, It's odd.

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** but honestly like a good sweet potato pie too was good if you make a good sweet potato pie I like you. I like you a lot.

**Darrell:** Like a pot roast.

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** So you got to

**Mike:** crazy because Turkey's good.

**Darrell:** Turkey is

**Mark:** To

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** better know this, are you guys light meat, white meat or dark meat kind of turkey guys? I'm a dark meat guy. I'm very spoiled with dark meat.

**Darrell:** I'm all meat.

**Mark:** Uh,

**Mike:** Same.

**Mark:** man,

**Darrell:** gobble.

**Mike:** along with the gravy.

**Mark:** I'm, yeah, I guess a few supplement with gravy, but nah, I've always, there's this thing where I just start getting lazy. Like I like the more tender, the less work I'm into that, I get really lazy in that aspect, but let's celebrate.

**Mark:** Cheers to that. Thanksgiving is complete. The next day, It is time. It is [00:34:00] time. It is. Dun You've watched Home Alone Parts 1 and 2 multiple times. A Christmas Story

**Mike:** times.

**Mark:** is A Christmas Story is on in the background on TBS and TNT on a 24 hour cycle. The Christmas tree is right then and there. Now, it's kinda weird.

**Mark:** I don't know if I should even be saying Unorthodox gift because I don't even know what yeah a gift. It's a gift now. What how about this? Let's just make it really selfish. What is the one gift you want? It's we it's been a long time since I've said Or I've ever been asked, Mark, what do you want on your Christmas wishlist?

**Mark:** We're not there anymore. It's our turn to be the ones giving back, but I want to put it out there. Yeah, you go, look at that. That's easy. All right. What do you want as your Christmas gift? What is the, Darrell gets to put his Christmas wishlist up. Santa's definitely going to, or potentially fulfill it. First line item from at puff provisions, Darrell.

**Mark:** His [00:35:00] Christmas wish list says this. Mike's already got his locked down.

**Mike:** I do.

**Mark:** that was really quick. You know what, I kinda don't Yeah, I don't care if it's unorthodox or whatnot or weird or whatever. Just, what do you want? What do you want for Christmas? Channel your inner kid. Channel your inner ten year old.

**Mark:** Or, pretend ten year old. I don't care.

**Darrell:** I'm not original.

**Mike:** mean?

**Mark:** What the hell does that mean?

**Darrell:** I just want money. Give me money. Why beat around the bush? Don't go shopping for me. I'm not gonna wear that sweater. Give me money. I will buy what I want.

**Mike:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Darrell:** And

**Mark:** That is,

**Darrell:** you.

**Mark:** that is the most,

**Mike:** think

**Mark:** I've ever heard.

**Mike:** you

**Mark:** straight up from an Asian background like that.

**Darrell:** I'm a dad. I'd be too burnt out doing the shopping already. Just,

**Mike:** all later.

**Mark:** Do you want it even nicely present it to you in a card? In a, in maybe Chinese form with a red envelope?

**Darrell:** like to know who gave it to me so I can say [00:36:00] thank you.

**Mark:** Of course, but you don't care if it's if someone's insensitive enough to

**Darrell:** floor, I'd be like, hey, that's for me. Merry Christmas.

**Mark:** Okay, so you know what I like this the puff provisions 28 gram christmas tree of hybrid flowers right there nice mounted triangle right there a nice okay, we'll be nice We'll calculate for the rate of inflation for Darrell.

**Darrell:** Igloo,

**Mark:** They have those fanny packs that have WWE championship belts on them.

**Darrell:** seen that.

**Mark:** In fact, you've socialized one or two with me before, and I want one underneath the tree. I want, The one that, I don't even want those new [00:38:00] school John Cena ones or whatever the modern, these modern day kids are doing.

**Mark:** I want some old school shit.

**Darrell:** one.

**Mark:** Attitude Era shit.

**Darrell:** Attitude Era, belt

**Mike:** If I were to see you walk in, oh, this dude has a championship belt on his,

**Mark:** Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yes.

**Mark:** I'm happy. Do we really have to get dark before we close it out, Mike?

**Mike:** I was just kidding. It's not dark.

**Mark:** Now I'm disappointed. We'll judge it ourselves. We'll judge it ourselves.

**Mike:** Yo, you guys judge,

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** maybe this will be a therapy session, but

**Mark:** Here it is.

**Mike:** lines of Darrell where , I want money, but I want $10 billion.

**Darrell:** Just on the floor.

**Mike:** [00:41:00] Yeah.

**Mark:** to fathom,

**Mike:** billion

**Mark:** trying to fathom that many hundreds on the floor. Hold on. Go on.

**Mike:** yeah. I'm tired guys.

**Mark:** I know. It's,

**Darrell:** I, I, exactly. Mike shares my sentiment, right?

**Mark:** You know what?

**Mike:** tired.

**Mark:** You know what I've found? I've found to be very, very enlightening in the last few years alone. If you recall, we had. An episode many, not many years ago, but a few years ago when the lottery jackpot was at its record, 1. 08 billion.

**Mark:** And it was just some young gentleman out of LA that won it.

**Mark:** And then he started when he, when his identity got exposed, all that stuff, good on him. Everyone gets the luck of the draw. He happened to have one of the best ones out there.

**Mike:** Yep. Yep.

**Mark:** You'd think he'd be doing noble things with it, but no. He didn't. He's simply spending guys buying 26 million mansions in high end parts of L.

**Mark:** A. Buying super race cars. I don't [00:42:00] even, and just living the life. It's not, there's nothing philanthropic about it. There is no, there's no, ideology attached to it. It's just. Bam, it's a money pit that he landed on and he's going for it,

**Darrell:** it's someone who doesn't know how to deal with large sums of money.

**Mark:** which I think is 99. 9 percent of all jackpot winners from, when you watch the documentaries on and the advice you get from them. Yeah.

**Darrell:** Yeah, statistically most jackpot winners end up blowing it

**Mark:** We'll segue into that as a therapy session next time, Mike, but, you were very precise. Does it have to be precisely 10 billion? Are you going to be mad if I only put 9 billion on the floor?

**Darrell:** that's fucking

**Mark:** Wow.

**Darrell:** dr Evil

**Mark:** Yeah. He wanted to, he, it has to be.

**Mike:** man. You know why? You know why? You want to, really want to know why?

**Mark:** Actually, yeah, I do. I can't understand the difference between being content with nine billion versus ten billion, but okay. I'm sure a billionaire could say that's a big difference. Yeah.[00:43:00]

**Mike:** Because I want to live like that guy.

**Mark:** Huh.

**Mike:** won the 1 billion,

**Mark:** Huh.

**Mike:** but I want, I don't want,

**Mark:** Go on. Feel free. Let it out.

**Mike:** I just want to do it. I just want to do

**Mark:** There is no rhyme or reason.

**Mike:** never, there is no worry.

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Mike:** is no worry,

**Mark:** understand.

**Mike:** Of course, I'm still going to do good. And, yeah, I'll

**Mark:** of course.

**Mike:** something. I'll kick you guys a little, little

**Darrell:** right

**Mike:** and there.

**Darrell:** Yeah, the minute he gets his 10 billion. you bitches. I'm out

**Mike:** No. So that's why it's 10 billion. And so I can still help

**Mark:** What is that? What? Very good. I like that.

**Darrell:** i'm charity now?

**Mark:** Hey, dude, with that kind of leverage, yeah, we are.

**Mike:** being like happy for 50 on the ground.

**Mark:** And here I

**Darrell:** the message of

**Mark:** am.

**Darrell:** christ the message of christmas is to be grateful We went the exact opposite of the Christmas message.

**Mark:** My precious.

**Mike:** Oh Mike went the opposite of the Christmas message. He said, I want 10 billion. I want to wipe it with, I want to wipe my ass with it. Set it on fire

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** [00:44:00] We would be, we would definitely be a charity case in that the dynamics are completely flipped and upended. Now, what is that floating meme? I wouldn't say anything, but there would be signs, right? What would be the first sign, Mike, if you were to embrace the spirit of that meme?

**Darrell:** You know

**Mark:** I wouldn't say anything, but there would be signs. What would be the first sign indicating that, that 10 billion happened underneath that tree? What is the first sign that, that Puff Provisions Mike exposes of himself at?

**Mike:** my,

**Mark:** Oh yeah, he got a little something. What would be the, what would be the attribute?

**Mark:** Would it be like, 24 karat gold this? A hot pink Tesla. I don't know, carbon fiber Tesla. I don't know. What the fuck is it?

**Darrell:** We're all invited to, to, Puff Provisions Mike's New Year's Eve party on his compound.

**Mark:** When Mike throws the white party. When Mike throws the white party.

**Mike:** and

**Darrell:** oh,

**Mike:** to this stupid. I'm not even high. I would be

**Mark:** Embrace the spirit of the meme. [00:45:00] Embrace it.

**Mike:** Christmas Day.

**Mark:** it. Armour.

**Mike:** Say, for instance, say, for instance, I got it a little bit before Christmas Day. I create an armored Santa's sleigh.

**Mark:** Oh. Very, slightly provocative. I like it. I like it.

**Mike:** drive around and I would have balls of money painted at snowballs. And I would just start pegging fools.

**Mark:** Oh man.

**Darrell:** that's,

**Mike:** i'm tired. I'm tired and i'm angry.

**Mark:** Which one are you?

**Mike:** you to know that i'm richer than you And i'm gonna hurt you with this money.

**Mark:** Oh man, you know what?

**Mike:** I would

**Mark:** I would be so happy if I was on the receiving end of all that, of those snowballs. I would.

**Mike:** You know what? would be Santa and i'm so giving Darrell and Mark you guys would be my elves handing me the snowballs

**Mark:** Yes, master. Yes, master.

**Mike:** Now i'm

**Mark:** Yes, Santa. Yes, Santa. Okay. I didn't know, I didn't know how extreme you were getting

**Mike:** No,

**Mark:** because you went from zero.

**Mike:** still in the spirit [00:46:00] of

**Mark:** Okay. Because he went from zero to 10.

**Darrell:** to throw the

**Mark:** I know.

**Darrell:** have to

**Mark:** No.

**Darrell:** no,

**Mark:** We don't have that power. We don't have that. Dude, he went from zero to ten billion real quick.

**Mark:** Okay? Okay, that was pretty fast. I was,

**Mike:** It's not dark, but,

**Mike:** dark.

**Mark:** it's not dark at all, actually. It's,

**Darrell:** feel

**Mark:** very, it's,

**Darrell:** that's where you lose your first billion, just that. Just that Christmas morning alone.

**Mike:** the billion, buddy.

**Darrell:** other billy.

**Mark:** that's why he was so precise, saying that's the difference between nine and ten billion. It's one billion, it's one billion dollars worth of anger that he needs to

**Darrell:** should

**Mark:** get out.
