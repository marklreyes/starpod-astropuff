[00:00:27] **Intro:** I mean, it's all in the name. It's not that deep. This is
Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Do not adjust your set.

[00:00:36] **Robbie Wagner:** What's up everybody. This is a whiskey web and
whatnot. We have a guest today.

[00:00:41] **Robbie Wagner:** This is Adam Argyle. You may have seen him very
recently also on the show.

[00:00:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** and he's back again. Uh, I don't know why he
yeah, he just well, I didn't bring that but

[00:00:52] **Robbie Wagner:** well, I have a a special.

[00:00:55] **Adam Argyle:** Ooh. Hey, whoa. And it's like a branded [00:01:00]
mixer or what's

[00:01:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** it's a

[00:01:02] **Adam Argyle:** flavors.

[00:01:03] **Robbie Wagner:** so they have different flavors because they're
playing the seltzer game but this one is mixed berry

[00:01:07] **Robbie Wagner:** citrus the the normal one is grapefruit like you
know like the normal one and that one tastes exactly the same it's a non
alcoholic one but this one I don't know I'm just gonna try a different flavor
they can't all be the same flavor so

[00:01:20] **Robbie Wagner:** whatever

[00:01:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** so Boozy Fresca is I mean, that's That's genius.
That's what I have to say. Why didn't we do this sooner? That's what I

[00:01:29] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. The mash bill is, uh, let's see, uh,
contains no juice. And if you have questions, you can visit frescomixed. com.

[00:01:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh

[00:01:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** You'll never find this anywhere overseas.
Definitely, instant cancer.

[00:01:46] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. The fact that it doesn't say like contains
no, uh, you know, all the chemicals and stuff they always advertise, like you
buy anything in Europe and it's like, it doesn't have this and this and this and
this.

[00:01:56] **Robbie Wagner:** And you're like, cool. Well, okay.

[00:01:57] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:01:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** you're like, [00:02:00] oh, well, and it's
delicious, that's weird. Why did we put all that shit in there anyway? Well, I
am

[00:02:06] **Adam Argyle:** and yikes.

[00:02:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** yikes.

[00:02:09] **Adam Argyle:** put nasty stuff on the packaging. They're like,
here's a

[00:02:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, I bet. Yeah.

[00:02:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:02:19] **Adam Argyle:** like, what else should we do that with? Hey, are
there any JavaScript libraries? We should put a label like that on there. It's
like may cause death.

[00:02:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:02:26] **Robbie Wagner:** Ooo, controversial.

[00:02:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** Includes

[00:02:29] **Adam Argyle:** spicy. There it

[00:02:30] **Adam Argyle:** is,

[00:02:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** I want that. Yeah. You already

[00:02:33] **Robbie Wagner:** require you to write, , object oriented code.

[00:02:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** require you to use objects and,

[00:02:40] **Adam Argyle:** Oh yeah, it's callback, so we should just throw
someone into the callback hell, you know, and let them try to recursively
navigate out of it. Can you succeed and

[00:02:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** Build a website with jQuery UI and Bootstrap.
Enjoy! wait, I am

[00:02:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I was okay with it. It was a lot easier
than, , [00:03:00] Backbone, but Okay.

[00:03:01] **Robbie Wagner:** not enjoying trying to remove jQuery UI from our
work code base

[00:03:05] **Robbie Wagner:** right

[00:03:05] **Adam Argyle:** Hmm.

[00:03:05] **Adam Argyle:** And

[00:03:06] **Robbie Wagner:** but

[00:03:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** is amazing. That's worth applying for. , so I'm
actually having the Standard Spirit Wormwood Rye because I discovered that this
is one that I had in the arsenal that Robbie doesn't have and it's not something
to easy get and blah blah blah blah blah so I'm just going to go ahead and break
it open now.

[00:03:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's very interesting. So it is a spirit
distilled from a normal grain mash bill and flavored with wormwood and other
herbs. Herbs, so it has like an absinthe like quality is what I'm

[00:03:35] **Robbie Wagner:** Is it.

[00:03:35] **Robbie Wagner:** aged in it? Are they like

[00:03:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh, no, I think they flavor it. So, high rye
thin mash with

[00:03:41] **Robbie Wagner:** a dust, put it in there.

[00:03:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** I didn't, I didn't ask these kind of

[00:03:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** questions.

[00:03:45] **Adam Argyle:** cast a spell. You're like,

[00:03:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** Can I,

[00:03:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** can I get, can I get, Is it possible to finish
the sentence? I'm not sure. Uh, Highratherin Thin Mash with Wormwood finished
with four char levels of American and French Oak for a range of Butterscotch,

[00:03:59] **Adam Argyle:** there's four [00:04:00] Charles in

[00:04:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** Kemp. Char levels. char

[00:04:02] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, char levels, not

[00:04:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Oh, you don't know about that? Um.

[00:04:06] **Adam Argyle:** levels.

[00:04:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, various levels of Charles.

[00:04:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** No, there's a thing. So for bourbon, the char
Yeah, I am. The, uh, the char levels are another thing that is, , bourbon is
required to a particular char level with American oak. But this has other
things. It does say it has no anise or licorice, , as part of its flavor
additions. And it's made with local rye and corn in the column of our still.

[00:04:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** So,

[00:04:30] **Robbie Wagner:** think my fallback, profession when this doesn't
work out is

[00:04:35] **Robbie Wagner:** going around and making sure the char on the
barrels is correct.

[00:04:39] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah. Who, what do you call the chart? The char
person, the char cat, you know,

[00:04:42] **Adam Argyle:** the,

[00:04:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't know. Yeah, like the, uh, I forget even
what it's called, the people who make the barrels. It's like, uh, not rickery.
What is it? It's, yeah, the staves put together. I can't remember what that, but
I'm sure it's somebody that works at the place that makes the barrels. That's a
whole industry

[00:04:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** unto

[00:04:58] **Robbie Wagner:** I want to say something, but [00:05:00] I feel
like I'm

[00:05:00] **Robbie Wagner:** wrong.

[00:05:01] **Adam Argyle:** Crafting

[00:05:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** ahead and say it. No one will know. If you say
it with conviction, people will think we're geniuses. We've been doing it for
three

[00:05:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, no, I was right. Okay, it's a Cooper. A

[00:05:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, there you go. Yeah,

[00:05:12] **Robbie Wagner:** I was wanting to say that, and then if it turned
out to be like the guy who made shoes, I was gonna look fucking dumb, so I
didn't want to

[00:05:17] **Robbie Wagner:** do

[00:05:17] **Adam Argyle:** Oh,

[00:05:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's a cobbler. That's a cobbler, yeah.

[00:05:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** And not

[00:05:21] **Adam Argyle:** love that phrase that a cobbler's kids have no
shoes. Do you think the web, the web developers, kids will have no websites? Is
that the,

[00:05:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** They definitely don't. I mean, do you have

[00:05:30] **Robbie Wagner:** time they're old enough to make websites, no, they
will not have

[00:05:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah,

[00:05:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, the web

[00:05:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** developer's family? No.

[00:05:37] **Robbie Wagner:** No, I should though, I guess.

[00:05:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** Some people make emails and then like, Fair
enough. , okay, well I'm gonna taste this one. It doesn't smell like licorice,
just so you know.

[00:05:48] **Robbie Wagner:** They told you it wouldn't.

[00:05:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** it says it has none in

[00:05:51] **Adam Argyle:** and how did you say Annis again?

[00:05:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Anise? Star of an Star anise?

[00:05:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** Anise? Anus?

[00:05:57] **Adam Argyle:** Or are you wrong?

[00:05:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** Why do you want to say [00:06:00] anus?

[00:06:01] **Adam Argyle:** Well, anise. It's not a

[00:06:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** Anus? Anus? I don't know.

[00:06:05] **Adam Argyle:** Uh,

[00:06:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, uh, I don't know.

[00:06:10] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm trying to look it up. Let's

[00:06:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay, there we go. Wow, we worked through this
tasting. It's very difficult. Adam, why don't you pour yourself something?

[00:06:17] **Adam Argyle:** I've

[00:06:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Anis. It is Anis.

[00:06:20] **Adam Argyle:** It's anise. Oh,

[00:06:20] **Adam Argyle:** sweet.

[00:06:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** So it's

[00:06:22] **Adam Argyle:** I love it when

[00:06:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** Star

[00:06:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** of anus. Anus. Star of anus. That's something,
too. Oh my gosh.

[00:06:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** This

[00:06:29] **Adam Argyle:** I just like the choc chocolate anise. You know,
like, uh, that sounds like a band name.

[00:06:34] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yes.

[00:06:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay.

[00:06:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Anis

[00:06:39] **Adam Argyle:** what this whiskey tastes

[00:06:40] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm going to continue to say it wrong.

[00:06:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I'm going to go with Anise because I
don't, I don't want to have to explain that to my kids. Oh, interesting. I don't
know if you saying chocolate, , affected me, but it has a little bit of a, like
a, a dark chocolate, like, you know, a little bit of a bitter chocolate, , in
the beginning.

[00:06:58] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm getting

[00:06:59] **Adam Argyle:** has a peppery [00:07:00]

[00:07:00] **Robbie Wagner:** mixed berry citrus.

[00:07:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** It definitely has a little bit of licorice like
flavor to it, though. And then a little bit of, like, that light nutmeg. It's
very interesting, I would have to say. I don't know if I like it or don't like
it. Quite yet. I'm warming up, but it, you know, to me in general, it's kind of
like a flavored rye.

[00:07:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** So I'll just consider it more of a flavored, you
know, American whiskey. I'm not sure I'm prepared to rate it on our

[00:07:27] **Robbie Wagner:** Well, it will be a, uh, inaccurate rating because
we won't be able to average it amongst everyone rating it,

[00:07:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's true. so. I'll skip the rating and just
let people know. This is

[00:07:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** interesting. It's

[00:07:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** worth

[00:07:38] **Robbie Wagner:** time. We'll try it again.

[00:07:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:07:40] **Adam Argyle:** Put it in your whiskey

[00:07:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** entry would be Yeah, yeah, I'll just keep it to
myself. Go ahead and DM me on, , Twitter. Because it's the only place so far. ,
socially I'm willing to tolerate. If everybody leaves

[00:07:54] **Robbie Wagner:** Everyone's on Blue Sky now,

[00:07:56] **Adam Argyle:** everyone's on blue sky, dude. I swear. Twitter is
full of bots right now. Like [00:08:00] I'm like, I don't know anyone really on
there yet. Things seem active. And I'm like,

[00:08:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** I might be just done with the whole social media
thing again. I don't need it that much.

[00:08:08] **Adam Argyle:** I reject it all. I mean, you could

[00:08:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:08:11] **Adam Argyle:** own your

[00:08:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** I might end up there, so we'll see. But for the
time being, message me on there if you're

[00:08:16] **Adam Argyle:** you can host

[00:08:17] **Adam Argyle:** your own blue sky content. In case you're interested
in

[00:08:20] **Adam Argyle:** that, you don't even have to use the site. Could
just be a way people find you, but you're totally own your own shit. It's on
your own servers. , you post to it using the protocol. It retrieves from your
server as a protocol. I mean, it's kind of cool how you don't have to rely on
blue sky and there's even apps like gray sky.

[00:08:38] **Adam Argyle:** There's other UIs that interface with the backbone
and it's pretty cool stuff. I don't know. It's a little bit different. It's also
very, very similar, but it's a little bit different.

[00:08:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** Heh heh I just, it sounds like a lot of work.

[00:08:51] **Robbie Wagner:** The only thing that I hate so far is if you have
more than one account. You know, on Twitter you can just hit the picture to
switch [00:09:00] accounts.

[00:09:01] **Robbie Wagner:** I have to go into settings, switch my account,
find the post I wanted to comment on again. it's super annoying. So, yeah. Fix
that and uh, Dan, fix that please.

[00:09:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Um, otherwise it's good.

[00:09:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** Den den. Den den. Those noodles are amazing, by
the way. Den den noodles? Fire.

[00:09:19] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah.

[00:09:20] **Adam Argyle:** Dan

[00:09:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** always like a dan dan noodle. So,

[00:09:22] **Adam Argyle:** It's fun to say things

[00:09:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** you know, that, uh,

[00:09:24] **Adam Argyle:** It's a Chuck Chuck noodle. It's a Chuck Chuck bear.
See? Now it's a cute

[00:09:28] **Adam Argyle:** bear. It's a

[00:09:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** is it have to be, it has to be just kind of like
You can't really go Adam Adam. Adam Adam Adam Adam.

[00:09:36] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah, my name sucks.

[00:09:37] **Robbie Wagner:** it does have to be one

[00:09:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** quite the same flow.

[00:09:39] **Robbie Wagner:** All right, let's get to

[00:09:40] **Robbie Wagner:** the, the most important topic right now.

[00:09:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah.

[00:09:45] **Robbie Wagner:** Is cereal soup?

[00:09:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** I will jump it into the whatnot.

[00:09:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:09:50] **Adam Argyle:** It's

[00:09:50] **Robbie Wagner:** That's what I titled our, our title. So we have
to, yes,

[00:09:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** the cri Actually,

[00:09:56] **Robbie Wagner:** the definition

[00:09:56] **Robbie Wagner:** of

[00:09:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** What is the definition of soup, right? Uh,
things in a

[00:09:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** broth y

[00:09:59] **Adam Argyle:** [00:10:00] bowl. You know, some chunks in

[00:10:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Must it be warm? Um,

[00:10:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** No, cause gazpacho is

[00:10:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** soup.

[00:10:05] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah,

[00:10:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:10:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** gazpacho. Yeah. Cold

[00:10:08] **Robbie Wagner:** those are not good, whereas

[00:10:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ha ha

[00:10:11] **Adam Argyle:** Cereal

[00:10:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, subjectivity aside, I mean, I think you
need to define soup first. And

[00:10:21] **Robbie Wagner:** that you could drink, or eat with a spoon, that is
mostly liquid and could have, you know, large pieces of other things in it that
you would have to

[00:10:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** So is

[00:10:33] **Robbie Wagner:** that couldn't be drinkable.

[00:10:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Is chili soup?

[00:10:36] **Robbie Wagner:** Hmm, I guess, I think there needs to be a certain
amount of

[00:10:39] **Adam Argyle:** There's like

[00:10:39] **Robbie Wagner:** if you poured it out, yeah, how, how much would
it, like, move? And, like, chili could kind of just stay the same shape, kind
of, depending on how thick It

[00:10:48] **Robbie Wagner:** is.

[00:10:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, it depends on how thick it

[00:10:50] **Robbie Wagner:** So, I, I do think, probably most of the time you
could consider chili soup.

[00:10:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay, so I think we have to We can consider, ,
cereal like breakfast [00:11:00] soup.

[00:11:00] **Adam Argyle:** Breakfast soup, it's sweet

[00:11:01] **Robbie Wagner:** are there any sweet soups?

[00:11:04] **Adam Argyle:** that's a good

[00:11:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:11:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** why not? Right,

[00:11:09] **Robbie Wagner:** I know I've had like a Yeah, like a you know
pumpkin soup or something, but it's still like slightly

[00:11:14] **Adam Argyle:** like a tea. You know, you

[00:11:15] **Adam Argyle:** got

[00:11:15] **Adam Argyle:** like a

[00:11:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** butternut squash is like I mean, this is along
the same lines of, I have asked this question, is a hot dog a sandwich? Hot dog
on a bun? Because that's also confusing. You use the term hot dog, or whatever,
the words hot dog, to mean both the sausage and the sausage on the bread.

[00:11:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** Is hot dog a sandwich?

[00:11:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then also, is a hamburger the sandwich? And
I saw this because I saw an advertisement that was like, get a Whopper sandwich.
And I was like, so they're saying get a hamburger sandwich basically, is
hamburger a sandwich?

[00:11:51] **Robbie Wagner:** you should be including sandwich? when you
describe those things

[00:11:54] **Robbie Wagner:** because you could have a hamburger without the bun

[00:11:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. And I advocate for using the [00:12:00]
term sandwich to mean includes bun.

[00:12:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** So I want a hot dog sandwich, or do I just want
a hot dog?

[00:12:05] **Adam Argyle:** Mmm.

[00:12:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hmm. So this is why cereal could also kind of
fall into that more blanket category. So breakfast soup. I'll have some
breakfast soup. , I'm going to have that tomorrow and tell my family I'm going
to have some breakfast soup.

[00:12:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** And you're like, what are you talking about?

[00:12:21] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I was just trying to think about like I
guess You do use the term sandwich for most sandwichy things. Like if you go to
Burger King and you're like, I want a Whopper, there'll be like the meal or just
the sandwich,

[00:12:35] **Robbie Wagner:** so you refer to it as a sandwich.

[00:12:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah. So just

[00:12:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** saying a

[00:12:39] **Robbie Wagner:** think, or am I wrong? Am I remembering how they
would say, I need to go to a Burger King and see what they say.

[00:12:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** it's just short form, like it's implied
sandwich. It is a sandwich, but it's implied. Cause you don't go and say, I'd
like a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. You know, if I'm getting Philly cheesesteak,
it's the whole thing. Nobody wants that without the bread.

[00:12:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's like [00:13:00] saying, I'll have it
without the whiz.

[00:13:03] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, I would not eat it without the whiz, though.
The

[00:13:05] **Robbie Wagner:** whiz is

[00:13:05] **Robbie Wagner:** the jam. That is all the fake chemicals. I need
the fake chemicals.

[00:13:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** you know, that's how you order it. WitWiz.
That's the

[00:13:14] **Adam Argyle:** It's like, uh, sometimes we have too

[00:13:15] **Robbie Wagner:** Isn't it implied that it comes with it?

[00:13:17] **Adam Argyle:** It better come with it. I mean, I think it should.

[00:13:20] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, like why would you need to say with when you
could just be like it just comes with it. I

[00:13:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** Because some people will get provolone and other
cheeses. I

[00:13:29] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, those people are

[00:13:30] **Adam Argyle:** good. Mmm, Provolone

[00:13:31] **Adam Argyle:** is

[00:13:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** Provolone is good, but I would kind of say
WitWiz is kind of, it's the

[00:13:36] **Robbie Wagner:** That's the classic,

[00:13:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's the classic, yeah.

[00:13:39] **Adam Argyle:** Sounds like a

[00:13:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** you know, you have it your way. That's how WitWi
is. What

[00:13:43] **Robbie Wagner:** I bet there is a rapper with that name.

[00:13:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Wiz Khalifa. So there's Anyway.

[00:13:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes. Well, I actually have no

[00:13:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Is he based, is he named after Cheez Whiz? I would
hope so.

[00:13:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** You know, I, we haven't had that conversation
yet, [00:14:00] so.

[00:14:00] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, you haven't?

[00:14:01] **Adam Argyle:** There's Mr. Cheezle from, uh, Grandma's Boy.

[00:14:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** I have never seen that.

[00:14:06] **Robbie Wagner:** have not

[00:14:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's Nick

[00:14:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Schwartzen's like, most popular movie, and I
don't know why, like, it's I think it was just at a point where like Nick
Swartzen was like blowing up and He was kind of annoying to me for a little bit
when that movie came out and I was like I just I need a break from this guy.

[00:14:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'll I'll see it later. It sounds dumb. Whatever
I'll see it later and then just 20 years later still hasn't happened he's funny.
I mean like i've definitely listened to his comedy stuff and everything but

[00:14:34] **Adam Argyle:** don't typically like stoner movies, but that one is,
like, on point. There's just some awesome parts where, like, his grandma drinks
his tea off the tin in his shelf, but it was actually weed. And then she, she's
like, I can hear my hair growing! Hey, there's a sandwich reference in there!

[00:14:48] **Adam Argyle:** She comes out with ice cream sandwiches and she
goes, do you want them on wheat or rye? Or a white or rye or whatever.

[00:14:53] **Adam Argyle:** She's got them on a tray. She's got ice cream in
between pieces of bread with lettuce. And she's like, who wants an ice cream
[00:15:00] sandwich?

[00:15:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, gosh. Yes, but not those. Well, there you
go, though. That's a very valid point already. there is a dessert sandwich. An
ice cream sandwich. Is,

[00:15:09] **Robbie Wagner:** But it's, but there's not a dessert soup, or like
a sweet soup,

[00:15:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. We,

[00:15:15] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:15:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** What about, well, it's not soupy enough, right?
Like, so some kind of chocolate mousse or whatever. I don't know.

[00:15:23] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, what if your applesauce Is very liquidy?

[00:15:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** applesauce dessert?

[00:15:27] **Adam Argyle:** Like if your ice cream melts, it becomes soupy as
well. It's like it went from not soup to soup right before your eyes.

[00:15:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, uh, I mean almost if like your milkshake.
I drink your milkshake, but it is soup now. It's almost like that, a little bit.

[00:15:46] **Adam Argyle:** is a function of method and is a method of function.

[00:15:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** sometimes. Method is usually what, a property on
a class or object? Yeah, it's a,

[00:15:54] **Robbie Wagner:** but A function doesn't have to be a method

[00:15:56] **Adam Argyle:** Yes, that's my understanding also. Do you think
sandwiches [00:16:00] and like this hot dog thing are similar? Or like, the hot
dog, you know, bread, has one connected side. It's only got one open face.
Right? and that's kind of clutch because it's catching shit. you know, it's the
diaper of the wiener. And Well,

[00:16:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** not old enough for that to be the problem or the
case, right? I hope, hopefully you're not wearing wiener diapers yet. But, uh,
I'm not far away.

[00:16:29] **Adam Argyle:** I just turned really red. I could feel how red, I

[00:16:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Not

[00:16:34] **Adam Argyle:** stumbled, I stumbled right across it. But I mean,
like, yeah, like thinking about like pitas, you know, like other things. I mean,
the point was still like, if you got the Pac Man sandwich, , you know, with only
one open face, you're like, that is kind of clutch in the eating vessel

[00:16:47] **Adam Argyle:** mechanism strategy. And as soon as it becomes un,
you're like, Connected. Like if you have a hot dog and the diaper disconnects,
you're totally like, what? This is junk to me now. You get upset. You're like
the whole purpose, your whole purpose is [00:17:00] gone. You know?

[00:17:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, because, like, hot dogs outside of
the bun basically should just get cut up and put into SpaghettiOs. Otherwise,
what's the point,

[00:17:10] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, I love hot dogs and

[00:17:11] **Robbie Wagner:** spaghettios.

[00:17:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, I like that. Or beans and franks, I can
even tolerate that. Like, SpaghettiOs, franks and O's, yes. Beans and

[00:17:19] **Robbie Wagner:** something

[00:17:20] **Adam Argyle:** good stuff. Yeah.

[00:17:22] **Robbie Wagner:** there's something about how the, the ones that
come in the can

[00:17:25] **Robbie Wagner:** are even lower quality than the like minced
mystery meat crap you would buy anyway.

[00:17:32] **Robbie Wagner:** And that just tastes so good.

[00:17:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah. It's like the Vienna sausage of, of
meats or something like that. Like, I actually like canned meats. , because I
grew up, uh, with a trash mouth, apparently. Because, like, potted meat, Vienna
sausages, spam. I love all these things. I have no problem digging into that.
So,

[00:17:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't

[00:17:52] **Robbie Wagner:** It's the salt and the chemicals makes everything

[00:17:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah.

[00:17:55] **Adam Argyle:** Is there a JavaScript library that's like this where
you're like, it's not good for me. It's the end of the [00:18:00] meat. You
know, it's the last little bits of the library JavaScript, but you know what? I
just can't stop using it. It's just too good and delicious. It's like a guilty
pleasure,

[00:18:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** I mean, I think, like,

[00:18:11] **Adam Argyle:** like, moment

[00:18:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** Let's think of it that way. Like, yeah, like,

[00:18:14] **Robbie Wagner:** I do use a lot of moment,

[00:18:15] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:18:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** You know? Like, Lodash, is like a jQuery, like,
library that was, like, you know, such a helper for so long, and it was just
easy button to kind of keep rolling with it.

[00:18:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** And when I see Lodash, like, in a project now, I
kind of feel like, why? But then it's

[00:18:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** already there,

[00:18:33] **Robbie Wagner:** wanted to group by and group by wasn't out

[00:18:35] **Robbie Wagner:** yet.

[00:18:35] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah. Or they want to do certain things in like a
one liner where we're like, no, I shall use ES6. I shall continue nesting and
using, multiple ternaries in line.

[00:18:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** I, I will, I want to keep this standards sticker
on my laptop. And in order to do so, I must write it out 400 lines.

[00:18:55] **Adam Argyle:** What is your favorite color? I like that we just
turned into, Oh shoot, what's that

[00:18:59] **Adam Argyle:** movie? [00:19:00]

[00:19:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** The right answer was green.

[00:19:02] **Adam Argyle:** Python. Monty

[00:19:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. Is that the one
where like, You shall not pass. You must answer these three questions.

[00:19:12]

[00:19:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** These questions? Thrice. Or three, is it? Yeah,
it's been a while.

[00:19:16] **Adam Argyle:** What is your favorite color?

[00:19:18] **Adam Argyle:** This is how you should ask the spicy questions.

[00:19:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** Maybe

[00:19:25] **Adam Argyle:** a cereal a soup?

[00:19:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** we're gonna start to change the format, which
means we'll probably get less guests, but, we'll try the whiskey a little bit in
the beginning, and then, like, before each hot take, you have to take a shot of
that whiskey. One ounce shot, and then

[00:19:43] **Adam Argyle:** That is very Hot Ones, which y'all were like
originated on, right? It's a good idea to follow the

[00:19:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** I say it is inspirational to just entering the
idea of duress, and having a good time.

[00:19:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** Not necessarily duress because like alcohol
isn't spicy. My mouth is on hot or whatever you're on [00:20:00] fire or
whatever Well, we would just want people to like come a little bit out of their
like professional shell They're like I have this spiel about the thing. I'm here
to talk about when we want you to relax some yeah hot dog

[00:20:11] **Adam Argyle:** commentary.

[00:20:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** Adam Argyle author of the JS library hot dog
diapers

[00:20:17] **Robbie Wagner:** I bet there isn't one already.

[00:20:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm certain you could definitely have that.

[00:20:21] **Adam Argyle:** And then

[00:20:22] **Adam Argyle:** one of

[00:20:22] **Adam Argyle:** the errors that it admits says, says not hot dog.
You're like, you tried to put something inside of this. That's not hot.

[00:20:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, how would those sell? If you like started
a bakery and then like would package hot dog buns, but you just called them

[00:20:38] **Adam Argyle:** Dude. Burrito tape sold good. If burrito tape can
sell well, I

[00:20:42] **Adam Argyle:** think maybe I'll make hot dog tape. Yeah. Burrito
tape. Do you know?

[00:20:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** No, I that just keep your burritos closed?

[00:20:47] **Adam Argyle:** it will. Yes, it goes around the, okay. So like,
imagine, , it was kind of like edible tape. So instead

[00:20:53] **Adam Argyle:** of

[00:20:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah. Is it kind of

[00:20:55] **Adam Argyle:** in something, you put this tape on the burrito and
then you can just eat it as you go.

[00:20:58] **Adam Argyle:** There's none of this unfolding the [00:21:00] diaper

[00:21:00] **Adam Argyle:** ritual.

[00:21:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** the seaweed tape that goes around, uh,

[00:21:04] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah,

[00:21:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** is it, Nagori or whatever? Yeah, the sushi and
stuff. I could see that, except for, I do believe if you just warm up your, ,
tortilla and then fold it right, it's not a problem. It doesn't come

[00:21:15] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I've never learned how to fold it right. I
just

[00:21:17] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, that's a skill, dude. It's just like swaddling a
baby. You got to learn these things. Like, you got to know how to tighten up the
burrito and the arms on that little toddler, You

[00:21:26] **Robbie Wagner:** Well,

[00:21:26] **Robbie Wagner:** what's more important is the technique of eating.
You just hold the whole burrito and like never put it down and eat it as fast as
you can and then it doesn't matter how well it was wrapped.

[00:21:39] **Adam Argyle:** That is the fun way. The messy way. It's the
artistic

[00:21:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah, the artistic way. You gotta say this
correct. Star of an anus. Star of anus. Anus. There's no,

[00:21:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** there's,

[00:21:51] **Robbie Wagner:** Anus

[00:21:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** there's no anus in here. Or

[00:21:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** liquorice. liquorice.

[00:21:58] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, yeah, licorice, I don't know, just [00:22:00]
anus sounds like someone's name. Or wait, what? Did you say again? How did you
say it

[00:22:04] **Robbie Wagner:** Anise. Anise. Anise.

[00:22:07] **Adam Argyle:** a niece. I was like, yeah, I've got a niece around
the corner. Uh, her name is Annis.

[00:22:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** That is a little nicer, I'm just saying, for
her. Like if you named someone that, do you think they would like to be called?
Because I don't assume it's a male or female name, but, , would they like to be
called Anise or Anis?

[00:22:26] **Adam Argyle:** I don't know. It sounds like Alice, you know, it's
like Alice, but a little darker. Cause you're, you're a, you're black licorice.
You're sweet to some, but evil and gothic to others.

[00:22:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right. Yeah, this is true. It's a very good
point. And I, I also appreciate how much you're trying to tie this back to JS
libraries. I was thinking of like, high level categorization and like sandwich
short form is almost like, , you know, CSS shortcuts. You have the long

[00:22:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** property description. You've got the shortcuts
if you do it right. , yeah, they have them in Spain too, like, , they have them
in basically all, I forget what they call them. [00:23:00] They're just like
little snacks. They call them like little snack and whatever that

[00:23:03] **Robbie Wagner:** Little tea sandwiches.

[00:23:04] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah.

[00:23:05] **Adam Argyle:** A little

[00:23:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** the tea sandwiches. It's more like a tiny

[00:23:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** baguette kind of thing.

[00:23:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** okay, sing it.

[00:23:10] **Adam Argyle:** Oh,

[00:23:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** You and Robbie could have showed up with banjos.
He's got his now.

[00:23:15] **Adam Argyle:** Dang dude, I will help you get

[00:23:17] **Adam Argyle:** addicted. I'm still I'd love

[00:23:19] **Adam Argyle:** to thank so much Oh, I went to a show last night and
was watching like metal bands play and I was like I could do banjo rolls with An
electric banjo and it would be super cool. I've just slightly

[00:23:27] **Adam Argyle:** adjusted so it's not all like country bluesy I could
like Do like a dope metal riff with like a banjo roll.

[00:23:33] **Adam Argyle:** I'm like, you'd be fast

[00:23:34] **Adam Argyle:** to be sick. Anyway, so I

[00:23:36] **Adam Argyle:** kind of want to try that. Okay. The song goes, uh, I
went to England. I visited the queen. She had the smallest sandwiches that I had
ever seen. , I asked for another and she looked at me a door. She handed me a
sandwich and then she kicked me out the door.

[00:23:50] **Adam Argyle:** Ah, there's more verses. I can't remember them now,

[00:23:53] **Adam Argyle:** but the queen had small sandwiches. I guess

[00:23:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, tea sandwiches are small. They're like
little sandwiches and they just [00:24:00] have like a

[00:24:00] **Robbie Wagner:** They're always gross,

[00:24:01] **Robbie Wagner:** though. It'll be like,

[00:24:03] **Adam Argyle:** they look

[00:24:04] **Robbie Wagner:** it'll be like, Hey,

[00:24:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Maybe it's where

[00:24:06] **Robbie Wagner:** this, the thinnest bread you've ever seen.

[00:24:08] **Robbie Wagner:** And all we put in there was cucumbers. How about a

[00:24:11] **Adam Argyle:** or olive

[00:24:12] **Robbie Wagner:** instead? Yeah,

[00:24:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** with cucumbers and then like a smear of cream
cheese in that and they'll do like, uh,

[00:24:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** little smoked salmon ones. Actually, the last
time I was in England, we did tea service with the kids at a place and it was
amazing. They brought out all these like, , Great little sandwiches, and they
had a kids version of everything.

[00:24:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** And it was during Wimbledon, and so they had
these awesome pastries that looked like little tennis balls. And then they had
like cream in the middle and everything else. It was, it was great. And then for
the kids, they could get milkshakes and mint tea if they wanted. Which, no
caffeine and whatever else.

[00:24:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** That

[00:24:50] **Robbie Wagner:** Did all the boys come as well?

[00:24:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes, I

[00:24:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Cause they had milkshakes.

[00:24:54] **Adam Argyle:** Woo

[00:24:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, bring the boys to the yard. That woman was
married to Naz. I don't know if she still [00:25:00] is, but fun fact. Uh,

[00:25:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** Kellis, I think was her name? Or is her name? I
don't think she's dead.

[00:25:05] **Adam Argyle:** was pretty

[00:25:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** So she is, was, whatever else. Naz. that's a fun
fact. But didn't bring all the boys to the British yard that I'm aware of.

[00:25:12] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, speaking of that, have you heard of the band
Manchester Orchestra?

[00:25:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes. Love it.

[00:25:17] **Adam Argyle:** Yes, that's, I

[00:25:18] **Adam Argyle:** saw them in Thrice last night. but I was like, this
has a good tie in.

[00:25:22] **Adam Argyle:** Oh yeah, fresco. Is this peach

[00:25:23] **Adam Argyle:** flavored?

[00:25:24] **Robbie Wagner:** citrus.

[00:25:26] **Adam Argyle:** Mmm,

[00:25:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** What was your feedback on the first alternative
flavor? Hmm.

[00:25:33] **Robbie Wagner:** the, Grapefruit one, but with a little bit of
berries. I'm guessing this one is going to be Like just a little bit of
pineapple added. Let's see

[00:25:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. I wanted to ask, Okay, Adam, why does CSS
tooling get no funding and JS tooling gets a ton?

[00:25:50] **Adam Argyle:** where did you hear this? That's such a profound
thing to be saying.

[00:25:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** I I heard this from the notes that Robbie made,
so I probably stole his thunder on that [00:26:00] question, but I was just
trying to steer us into something technical and whatever else for our

[00:26:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** audience. know. I, I honestly do this one for
Charles, yo.

[00:26:07] **Adam Argyle:** is JS just seen as the, , omniscient control center?
cause I mean, it's like JS has to interface with HTML almost no way around it
unless you go canvas. so, okay, so with this tight dependency and sure JS can
create h TM L and create CSS and CSS can't really create JavaScript, although
it's starting to take its job in a lot of ways.

[00:26:29] **Adam Argyle:** HTML as well, taking the role of, uh, JavaScript's
job, but somehow JavaScript is seen as this like Mecca epicenter, and it's also
so conceptually powerful and mysterious that investors show up and say It's the
users. You have users, here is some money or whatever. but I don't know. I never
know how they're going to get that back.

[00:26:49] **Adam Argyle:** Like if you're getting into tooling and why not, if
you're trying to empower developers, we're here to empower developers with next
generation tooling in your kit. The red squiggles will now animate [00:27:00] as
they squiggle and give you actually meaningful information, which is not
possible anyway. Okay. Like what where is this for like the holistic view?

[00:27:10] **Adam Argyle:** Like why is I mean Svelte has like an HTML inter,
CSS has like style and some other things But like these are wimpy in comparison
to like what typescript does which is like I understand everything so much I
know more than you and I go shut up. No, you don't and it goes Yeah, I do. This
will be undefined once in a million years.

[00:27:25] **Adam Argyle:** You must fucking solve it I'm like TS ignore that
bullshit, you know, like anyway, sorry, there's

[00:27:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** couple.

[00:27:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, no, no, you're totally on the subject. I
have a couple of points. I think one of them is that JavaScript was perceived in
that very same way for quite some time. So I think it's by design that it has
been elevated in importance.

[00:27:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh yeah, back end developers, everyone else who
would, uh, talk shit about make things pretty. Well, let me show you how complex
and computer science y I can [00:28:00] become here

[00:28:00] **Adam Argyle:** bow to my stream of linked lists

[00:28:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right, exactly, right? And, and so it was just
They were linked in that same way, and then Folks came in and introduced
complexity for a myriad of reasons, whatever, trying to prove a point, maybe
they're right, maybe they're wrong.

[00:28:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm not here to judge that. But I think that is
part of it is that, you know, JavaScript was seen as that same way. And I think
tooling and TypeScript is another thing that, exposes how it can be A real
programming language, right? Like, not just a scripting language for the
browser, but you can actually make full on applications.

[00:28:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** Which, yes and no, right? Like, there's a
database in the browser, I guess you can do some things in that respect, and
whatever else, but, turns out, CSS doesn't have a bunch of that. I lost my
second point, so, sorry. That was one of

[00:28:54] **Robbie Wagner:** I do want to make a quick point that HTML also
doesn't really have [00:29:00] tooling.

[00:29:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:29:00] **Robbie Wagner:** So it's just that it's not a CSS specific problem.
It's that JavaScript is viewed as like where you do the heavy logic, whether
that's the right place to do it or not, or you should use web standards and like
built in, you know, native HTML stuff and like CSS

[00:29:17] **Adam Argyle:** to stand on the shoulders of giants, but I don't
want to stand on the shoulders of the HTML standards because they're not giants,
they're wimps.

[00:29:25] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:29:25] **Robbie Wagner:** the Giants do it all themselves. They write all
divs and

[00:29:30] **Robbie Wagner:** just hand roll everything.

[00:29:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** but the funny thing is, is there is no internet
without HTML, right? If there's no hypermedia, then there's no outlay of
information that interconnects to another hypermedia document. Like, if you
don't have those two things, you don't have the internet. So you can, you know,
Flashturbate, whatever, I don't know, I'm trying to think of whatever the new
word, you can do all this like complex masturbation on top and create HTML, but
[00:30:00] that's exactly what you're doing.

[00:30:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** JavaScript is creating CSS, creating HTML,
creating the things it requires in its environment, or they could be there
already and play together nicely. Depends, but without HTML, just everything
aside without HTML. Connecting to additional HTML within your own domain, or
elsewhere, there is no internet, so it doesn't fucking matter.

[00:30:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** So the web goes away and you can just make
software

[00:30:30] **Adam Argyle:** My servers keep running, Chuck, and all I need is my
JavaScript to have one

[00:30:35] **Adam Argyle:** thread don't need a server, and I will be faithful
to this forever.

[00:30:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** You just need a Raspberry Pi that you open up to
the internet and there you go. That's all you need. You could serve up

[00:30:48] **Adam Argyle:** Are there people reverse hacking? Like, what if I
opened up a port to the internet and I'm like, yes, I guess it's the honey
badger kind of concept. I'd be like, yes, try to invade me, you know? And it's
just like, invades me. And I claw and I'm like, I [00:31:00] got you now. And
you

[00:31:01] **Adam Argyle:** just, is a logging and monitoring app called Honey
Badger. I don't think that's what you mean, right? You're just trying to make
the Nat Geo joke like Honey Badger don't give a fuck?

[00:31:12] **Adam Argyle:** I don't know. Isn't honey badger was like the thing
where like you, you leave something out to entice them, , in

[00:31:16] **Robbie Wagner:** Mean honey

[00:31:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** Honey Pot. Honey

[00:31:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Pot. No, the Honey

[00:31:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** Pot. So it's hidden fields, it's hidden fields
that when the bot finds it, oh, that's

[00:31:26] **Robbie Wagner:** Whoa.

[00:31:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay.

[00:31:29] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh,

[00:31:29] **Robbie Wagner:** spooky

[00:31:30] **Adam Argyle:** just turn off. Hey. Yes. Who

[00:31:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:31:32] **Adam Argyle:** poopy?

[00:31:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** what happened there. Something happened here. ,
but I'm still recording.

[00:31:38] **Adam Argyle:** You

[00:31:39] **Robbie Wagner:** The room seems to be unlit.

[00:31:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** Welcome to another edition of Spooky Stories
from the Internet.

[00:31:48] **Robbie Wagner:** I feel like I should turn lights off around me and
match the

[00:31:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, you should do it.

[00:31:51] **Adam Argyle:** can't, I'm, it's daytime still.

[00:31:54] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh,

[00:31:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** my god, that's bright as shit. What do you guys
like? Do you like dark? Or do you like

[00:31:59] **Adam Argyle:** I mean, dark was [00:32:00] cool. You looked

[00:32:00] **Adam Argyle:** all

[00:32:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** Dark mode. Whoa,

[00:32:02] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh. All right. No, that's no, that was good. It
adjusted.

[00:32:05] **Adam Argyle:** I don't know. I like your chin and neck in the
frame. That's great.

[00:32:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** Maybe you see the wrinkles too much. What about
Okay. Yeah, I have no

[00:32:13] **Robbie Wagner:** turn that up. There you go. Just give it a second.

[00:32:16] **Robbie Wagner:** It'll look normal. There you go. Yeah

[00:32:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Robbie is a stickler for This is

[00:32:23] **Robbie Wagner:** The producer has to keep you on

[00:32:25] **Robbie Wagner:** track with the best quality and the best,

[00:32:27] **Robbie Wagner:** uh,

[00:32:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** assumes I'm, giving him a hard time. I'm making
fun of him. Which is usually

[00:32:32] **Adam Argyle:** you guys are a cute couple on here. You can keep
bantering in front of me and like bickering though. If you like,

[00:32:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Robbie, you're just gonna have to sleep on the
couch tonight. Okay? You

[00:32:42] **Robbie Wagner:** That's fine.

[00:33:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** Anyway,

[00:33:17] **Adam Argyle:** you, did you guys see when CSS made queries from a
database from an

[00:33:21] **Adam Argyle:** index

[00:33:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** no, but

[00:33:23] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, here's a question. Is it data or data

[00:33:25] **Robbie Wagner:** Usually data.

[00:33:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I say data, but I think people just, it's
kind of like radiator, radiator, right? Isn't like, radiator isn't technically
right, but there's vernacular, so then it's right

[00:33:40] **Adam Argyle:** I think router makes more sense than router, but we
say route cause we're all,

[00:33:44] **Adam Argyle:** but

[00:33:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** Rotorooter? Like that kind of thing? I always
think the

[00:33:47] **Robbie Wagner:** when you're talking about websites. Because when
you go, if you call everything root, you're talking about routes and like the
root of your application being like, you know, slash.

[00:33:59] **Robbie Wagner:** And then you're like, [00:34:00] root, root, root,
root, root, root, root. root. And I'm like, what did you even mean? You used
root for all these different words.

[00:34:05] **Adam Argyle:** Oh,

[00:34:06] **Robbie Wagner:** where? Like, so I do

[00:34:08] **Adam Argyle:** distinguishes. Yeah.

[00:34:10] **Adam Argyle:** That means we're

[00:34:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** Route. Router. Root. I

[00:34:16] **Robbie Wagner:** one that I would, uh, argue we might be right
about.

[00:34:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** think, I think you're on to something there. I
think that's absolutely, because if you say, oh, what's the root?

[00:34:25] **Robbie Wagner:** If you

[00:34:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** R O O?

[00:34:29] **Robbie Wagner:** conversation, it's unlikely you would be talking
about a route and a route of things that aren't technical in the same sentences.
But when talking about websites, it's a big, big thing.

[00:34:40] **Adam Argyle:** this, this sounds like a YouTube short that needs to
happen. You know, where we're just like, Hey dude, are you going to take the
route to get to the root? And once you're at the root, you can get to the route
that takes you to the other route. I don't know. There's gotta be a script that
would be funny,

[00:34:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** point. I want to regress briefly and say that,
my second point was, CSS tooling mostly [00:35:00] doesn't get funding, except
for Tailwind. did they even take funding, or are they bootstrapped, or?

[00:35:05] **Adam Argyle:** they're like Macklemore. Yo, they're self made. they
don't have a depth on

[00:35:09] **Adam Argyle:** anybody.

[00:35:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** to the thrift

[00:35:10] **Robbie Wagner:** I mean adam has like 100 000 teslas. So I think
he's probably making

[00:35:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** I mean, they're making money, but I just wonder,
like, is it because of investment? And then he's just like, Lambo, so people
like my stuff. Or, is

[00:35:25] **Robbie Wagner:** think it was investment a while long time ago But
I think now it's all just like people buy in the ui library stuff

[00:35:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, and then it's like lifetime access, and
then it's sort of like, but if you want the next thing, upgrade your lifetime

[00:35:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, i've paid them three times so far and we'll
probably continue to do so

[00:35:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. I have logged into the account where you
paid them three times so far.

[00:35:46] **Robbie Wagner:** although, the big problem is it's all Next. js,
which now no one can use because it's not an acceptable thing anymore. But, all
that aside,

[00:35:56] **Robbie Wagner:** we should do it in Astro

[00:35:58] **Adam Argyle:** get canceled. I mean I [00:36:00] saw all his
employees were like, I do not reflect things My employer says but then I saw
Sundar did the same thing and I'm like, dang it. Do I have to do this, too?

[00:36:07] **Robbie Wagner:** I just like to stir the pot. I tend to think that,
like, It doesn't really matter what your views are you should be able to express
them and you shouldn't be cancelled

[00:36:16] **Robbie Wagner:** for them for saying a thing once like

[00:36:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, now we just got cancelled, so thank you,
Robbie. But I will say that. I will say,

[00:36:23] **Robbie Wagner:** I have to condemn him to be not cancelled.

[00:36:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** Jason Freid and DHH had their thing a few years
ago where, like, we don't want politics in our business. We're just trying to do
business. And, we accept folks personal politics. We don't want that in the
business.

[00:36:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** It, , isn't reflective of our goals. It's, like,
all of those things. And I do think that that, like, incredibly muddies the
water. So it's a little bit like separate the art from the artist, but it is
also a little bit of like, if you dig into all kinds of like famous rich people
or just businesses in general, there's certain things that you're kind of
[00:37:00] not going to like, and then we've become a culture of like, Oh, this
is owned by, you know, Chick fil a is an open on Sundays and they hate gays, so
I don't like their chicken anymore, but I actually do like their chicken and
their waffle fries.

[00:37:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** So which, you

[00:37:14] **Robbie Wagner:** only when they're free though

[00:37:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, especially when they're free, but, you
know, do I not buy that anymore? Do I not utilize, like, the best software
because the dude who was part of creating it is, I mean, I don't know, he's not
murdering people. If they're not murdering people and they have a personal
opinion, I don't, it's, it's

[00:37:34] **Robbie Wagner:** it also depends what your position is like as the
ceo You should just probably keep your mouth shut about most

[00:37:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** You probably, he should also, that's true. Like
I don't think that politics belongs in business, just like religion. But if you
open your mouth, I guess there are repercussions.

[00:37:54] **Adam Argyle:** damn that got heavy. We went from wiener diapers to
to that

[00:37:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** was given [00:38:00] in a moment

[00:38:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** where I maybe was This episode is sponsored

[00:38:03] **Robbie Wagner:** by Blue Sky.

[00:38:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** this episode is sponsored by Vercel. Because for
one, that fucker owes me an interview on this mediocre podcast with my

[00:38:14] **Adam Argyle:** His secretary drank the booze dude, you know, just

[00:38:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** Is one of them.

[00:38:18] **Robbie Wagner:** What if, what if he actually didn't even know,
like he wasn't getting the notifications and his, yeah, his assistant got the
whiskey, drank it all and said, oh, he can't make it

[00:38:28] **Robbie Wagner:** today.

[00:38:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** can't make

[00:38:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** it. Yeah. I mean, that's a good, that's a good
pull.

[00:38:32] **Robbie Wagner:** Which, if that's the case, that's kind of awesome.
I would love that, but

[00:38:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah. I'd accept that as a good
explanation of like, hey guys, cuz he's been on tons of podcasts. Like, I don't
know what about us specifically. I think it's

[00:38:46] **Adam Argyle:** He'd get on Trump's podcast. We know that now.

[00:38:50] **Robbie Wagner:** Mm hmm. Yeah, maybe a guest on Joe Rogan's show as
well.

[00:38:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** I mean, okay, but, nevermind. I'm going to start
[00:39:00] drinking. Like, I mean, Bernie has been on Joe Rogan's podcast,
right? Bernie Sanders, not just Trump. Like, let's not, you know, cast a
singular side.

[00:39:11] **Robbie Wagner:** I've never listened to it and honestly, sorry, I'm
cutting you right off, but I want to,

[00:39:16] **Robbie Wagner:** I want to uh, listen to Trump's episode because
everyone has been like, this made me want to vote for him. And I'm like, what
the fuck? Like, what could have been said in this episode? I now need to listen
to it and find out.

[00:39:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** I do think information is good. I mean, I think
you should get information from all sides of the argument, regardless of, you
know, where your feelings are. It's good to kind of understand where others
perspective is coming from, so

[00:39:42] **Adam Argyle:** Agree. That's always my number one question. I'm
like, Hey, tell me what you hope he does that, you know, just tell me your hopes
and dreams with, with your

[00:39:49] **Adam Argyle:** vote. Like, I'm just curious where you're if that's
the best thing, I mean, you know, what's done is done. So, I really hope it
works out, you know, overall. him speaking always seems a [00:40:00] little like
dumb. I would almost say like JD Vance has come off more like eloquent and
focused on on what he's trying to say but I don't

[00:40:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Well that's a totally different skill that I don't
have of being like, Alright, no prompter, no notes, like, Be, , someone
interesting that, you know, I would want to listen to. I would fail at that,
like, I think there's a,

[00:40:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think you're in the wrong

[00:40:24] **Robbie Wagner:** There's a subset of people that are like very good
and charismatic and can say everything and spin it well just because you can't
do that doesn't necessarily mean That like all of your ideas are wrong.

[00:40:37] **Robbie Wagner:** You're just like on the spot. You don't shine, you
know

[00:40:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Like you just need

[00:40:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** society. Right, but that's not modern society.
You need, I mean, in many professions, even if you want to be a technologist
online, streaming or doing podcasts and everything else, I think you need, to be
able to evoke your points and, ask good

[00:40:57] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah and be entertaining

[00:40:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** [00:41:00] Yeah, to a degree, because

[00:41:01] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, that's why I don't stream like I don't I
don't feel like I could code and like be You Engaging while coding. I'd just be
like typing and be like cool. You're watching what I'm

[00:41:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** I fucked up again. Oh, I fucked up again. Back,
back, back, back, back, backspace. Yeah, because even when I pair program, my
programming goes down like 50%. 100%.

[00:41:21] **Robbie Wagner:** It's the old saying that that my grandpa used to
say he's like one boy is one boy Two boys is a half a boy and three boys is no
boys at all Yeah,

[00:41:36] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, sometimes I think like shotgun debugging or pair
programming though. It's like, uh, I might be conceptually going slower, but the
checks and balances are way better than TypeScript. Like we kind of try to
attribute TypeScript as if there is a healthy person over your shoulder, right?
This is like, that's why he's called co pilot.

[00:41:51] **Adam Argyle:** We try to convince you that they're agents sitting
next to you, peacefully, not breathing sweet nothings in your But [00:42:00]
like kind of the reality is an actual human there. you may go slower. So like
TypeScript, , tries to pitch you that you're, I don't know. Anyway, but the
slower that they go, it's more that you're catching.

[00:42:08] **Adam Argyle:** You have dual perspectives co authoring. And I think
that's, what's cool where it's like co pilot is not co authoring. It's auto
completing. And what you need is someone to Co author with you to really suss
out the realities of the potentials of the intent of the script. Not the
realities of the, the script as it's, , purely theoretically written, you know,
to TypeScript where it's like doing deep insights in this sort of like edge case
analysis, where it's like when two people repair programming, we're high level,
we're almost at the opposite side.

[00:42:38] **Adam Argyle:** When I'm writing TypeScript, I'm. Down deep, I'm
typing stuff that maybe it's, it's a string. It's like, it's a type of string.
Yeah. But I'm like that type isn't good enough. I need to give something more
specific, whatever. Right. That's like, that's really down in the weeds, but
when you're pair programming with someone, you're in a higher level space.

[00:42:55] **Adam Argyle:** The code is actually just an implementation detail
of your you're not coexisting together, but you're like mind [00:43:00] melding
into this moment of the manifestation of an algorithm. I've always really liked
it. , I do agree that like on the surface, it can feel slower, but I feel like
the output of it is really strong.

[00:43:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** agree with your point. Overall, I think you make
a very great point in that when you're pairing, you're not trying to accelerate
your output. Right? And it doesn't matter that like whatever you're putting out
in the moment, you're you can't type, you can't whatever else. But you are
bringing a completely new perspective into what you're trying to address,
usually are asking the pair, not because like, Oh, I'm doing my thing.

[00:43:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** And I'm creating a signup form. And I've done
this a million times. And I kind of know what's up. Why don't you pair and join
me on that like that doesn't happen. It's usually like let's pair. I don't know.
I'm thinking this direction.

[00:43:44] **Robbie Wagner:** could if you're trying to, if you're the senior
and you're trying to be like, Hey, come learn how I did this,

[00:43:50] **Robbie Wagner:** the opposite pairing, you know,

[00:43:52] **Robbie Wagner:** but anyway, continue.

[00:43:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah. And and that still exists in that
like they drive and you [00:44:00] observe and you're just trying to like help
them through a thing. That's true. I think there is multiple facets. It's like
you're a junior. I'm here to just kind of like Be on your shoulder if you want
my help, but no problem.

[00:44:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then conversely you have the pairing or mob
programming. Mob programming can be really fun in your team when you like have a
big challenge and nobody's really clear. on what direction you want to go. And
you're like, live whiteboarding to a degree. Or you're like, live, like, I don't
know, we're just trying to figure this thing out.

[00:44:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** Not sure. This is what I was thinking. Oh, Adam
was thinking this other thing. And, Hot Dog Diaper was thinking something else.
And like, I, hadn't considered that perspective. Like, let's, let's fly through
a few of those.

[00:44:41] **Robbie Wagner:** This is somewhat maybe related to, you know how
everyone says like, the best way to get the best code advice is to just post
something you know is wrong and wait for people to come

[00:44:53] **Robbie Wagner:** correct you.

[00:44:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** you. Yeah, yeah. That's the old school stack
overflow trick

[00:44:58] **Adam Argyle:** Wait, Blue Sky, we need to start doing

[00:44:59] **Robbie Wagner:** [00:45:00] Yeah, but I wonder if it's like, if
that's like tied in your brain of like, that's what happens when you're pairing
or mobbing too.

[00:45:11] **Robbie Wagner:** It's not that you're like trying to do that. Be
that like, oh, you're wrong kind of thing, but you're just, it's easier to see
someone else make the mistake. Then when you're doing it, you're in the zone.
You're not like paying attention to what you're doing as much, you know.

[00:45:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I think that's fair. It's another
perspective overall.

[00:45:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think what we say is the exercise is
worthwhile regardless of the

[00:45:33] **Robbie Wagner:** Wait, you're supposed to exercise. Listen,

[00:45:43] **Adam Argyle:** This is a

[00:45:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes, yes, this is very heavy.

[00:45:47] **Robbie Wagner:** Taco Bell, the Taco Bell

[00:45:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** liquid.

[00:45:50] **Robbie Wagner:** is going to be demolished in two days.

[00:45:55] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't know what I'm going to do.

[00:45:56] **Adam Argyle:** Is there any cool mural art inside? Did you see that
[00:46:00] panic guy this guy's video his I think it was like a ted talk Oh, it
wasn't a ted talk. So, do you know panic the company that does uh, They've made
a couple games. They have the handheld uh video game that has this the wheel or
it's like a lever

[00:46:12] **Robbie Wagner:** one, the one I'm going to be sending to

[00:46:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Chuck.

[00:46:15] **Adam Argyle:** playdate the playdate Yeah, okay.

[00:46:18] **Adam Argyle:** So

[00:46:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, yeah, you haven't sent that yet?

[00:46:20] **Adam Argyle:** You

[00:46:20] **Robbie Wagner:** I have not sent it yet. I'm bad

[00:46:21] **Adam Argyle:** Did y'all trade Banjo for Playdate?

[00:46:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** No, no, I mean, just coincidentally,

[00:46:27] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:46:27] **Robbie Wagner:** bought the playdate or pre ordered it like years
before it came out and then I was like, you know group Quad Z like never getting
it whatever so I got it way later and was like, I don't really care about this
anymore So I've never opened it. So I was like, well Chuck you can have it. I
don't need it like

[00:46:45] **Robbie Wagner:** So I'm gonna send it to him

[00:46:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** uh, that's going to be a gift for my son for
Christmas because he's really into gaming, he has a Switch, he does some, , iPad
stuff, but

[00:46:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Hopefully, he's not watching right now

[00:46:57] **Robbie Wagner:** cuz then

[00:46:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** Heh. yeah, he's not, I can assure [00:47:00]
you. There's too many fucks in this show for him to watch on a regular basis. He
has seen it.

[00:47:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** I just, I put it up on YouTube before because he
likes some YouTube streamers and I was like, that's on YouTube. And he's like,
what? You're famous. And I'm like, absolutely. I am famous.

[00:47:17] **Robbie Wagner:** You listen to our, uh, the episode changelog
posted of us?

[00:47:22] **Adam Argyle:** did,

[00:47:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** some of

[00:47:23] **Robbie Wagner:** Jared was like, Chuck said we could bleep him, so
here we go.

[00:47:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** And they did. And they did

[00:47:29] **Adam Argyle:** It was record bleeps, right? He was like, I think we
have a record number of

[00:47:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's okay. I mean, I re I respect, I respect
their format. I respect, like I asked like, if you're gonna post it, I said, A
lot of fucks. Is that cool? And they were like, can we bleep you? And I was
like, you do you like, I have no problem with that.

[00:47:46] **Adam Argyle:** You know the

[00:47:46] **Adam Argyle:** FG scale, right?

[00:47:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** No. Is that a guitar thing or something? I don't

[00:47:52] **Adam Argyle:** No. Oh shit. I'm so happy I get to teach you this.
Okay. So here, this is even could be part of the title, I guess, because so it's
like, is, is cereal soup. [00:48:00] And why did we give so many FGs this
episode? FGs are fucks given so you just mentioned that like we've already given
out a lot of fucks given and so like the kind of the idea is like every day and
every person each has a limited number of fucks to spend and you're either the
type of person that has a ton of them, which means you're really concerned about
stuff.

[00:48:19] **Adam Argyle:** You're always busy. Putting your nose into things,
you're trying to control everything. You have a lot of fgs to spend. And then
you definitely know people that are like chill. And they're like, I don't have a
lot of fgs to spend, so I'm not gonna spend them here. But it comes in really
important when you're talking about like software and stuff.

[00:48:30] **Adam Argyle:** 'cause people have a butting head about like, this
is a button. And someone else will be like, that's not a button, that's a link
or whatever, right? And you're like, okay, uh, well that one actually has a
correct answer, but whatever. You'll have a scenario where people like butt
heads.

[00:48:41] **Adam Argyle:** And then you'd be like, how many FGs do you give
this?

[00:48:43] **Adam Argyle:** And the other person would be like, dude, this is
like a five FG. I'll spend five FGs on this. And the other person's like, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa. I was only like one FG that I thought it was a link. So if you're
really sure it's a button, it sounds like you're really sure. but yeah, so you
just have like, this is like a way to communicate how important something is to
you.

[00:48:57] **Adam Argyle:** It's also like a way to say like, what kind of
[00:49:00] personality type of view? Some people are born with a hell of a lot
of fucks to give and other people are born with not very many. And you can see
it

[00:49:06] **Adam Argyle:** manifest in their day to day life choices.

[00:49:08] **Adam Argyle:** The

[00:49:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** here we go. where do you think I lie on the FG
scale?

[00:49:12] **Adam Argyle:** Uh, I feel like you got a decent amount of flex to
give. You give them out pretty freely, but you give them out chilly, chill,
chill, Lee, that's not a word, but I said it twice though, to try to

[00:49:21] **Adam Argyle:** hope

[00:49:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** You did, you

[00:49:22] **Adam Argyle:** second time.

[00:49:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** have another.

[00:49:25] **Adam Argyle:** so that's nice. Yeah. You give, you give chill Fgs,
there you go.

[00:49:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** FGs, but not a ton. I'd give him out chill,

[00:49:31] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I, I feel like I don't have a ton, but I am
not chill about them.

[00:49:36] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm very opinionated

[00:49:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** I've worked with Robby in a

[00:49:39] **Robbie Wagner:** when, whenever, yeah, usually I'm even keel until
it's a thing I don't agree with. And then no,

[00:49:46] **Robbie Wagner:** it's,

[00:49:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** then he will wear you down. Robby is very good
at wearing you down. He'll

[00:49:51] **Adam Argyle:** He's got a big tailwind FG.

[00:49:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:49:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, for sure.

[00:49:54] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm fighting, I've been fighting that battle at
work since I started my job almost two years now.[00:50:00]

[00:50:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** I can understand why you'd want to get rid of
it, to a degree. Like, it's not cool, but is it not working anymore? That would
be my,

[00:50:08] **Robbie Wagner:** well, how deep you want me to go on this? So one
of the problems

[00:50:13] **Robbie Wagner:** is Amazon scans everything to be like, Hey, this
is a third party CDN. You shouldn't use that. So like a lot of our jQuery depths
we pull in are from an old CDN link. And so all of those had to be changed. we
had uh, jQuery, uh, what was it called, I forget, it's one of the jQuery UI
things, but it was for taking a text area and like, you know, dragging it and
resizing it, like jQuery resizable or something. And I was like, yo. Text areas
are already resizable. What the fuck are we doing? Why do we need a plugin for
this? and so delete that. Like, it's just stuff that was, it's crufty. It's
like, it's not inherently bad. Some of it may be useful. I don't, I'm not a
jQuery hater per se, but it's like, just think about it.

[00:50:59] **Robbie Wagner:** A [00:51:00] lot of it can be removed

[00:51:01] **Robbie Wagner:** pretty easily, and that should be done if it can
be easily removed.

[00:51:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, like if it's doing something that is
natively available to you, maybe consider,

[00:51:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. jQuery slider. That's a range input, dog.

[00:51:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Just, uh, replace that.

[00:51:16] **Adam Argyle:** you meant slider. You meant slider like range. Oh,
dang. I was like, are we going to talk about carousels? Cause

[00:51:21] **Adam Argyle:** Holy crap. That's like a

[00:51:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** slick. Wait, wait, wait, we can have a follow up
episode with you and Wheeler and slick carousel.

[00:51:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** talk about it.

[00:51:29] **Adam Argyle:** fun.

[00:51:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** based originally.

[00:51:36] **Adam Argyle:** I've been building carousels for like months now.
and the stuff we're working on is like super sick. Like imagine you just have
like a horizontal carousel and it says like horror movies and there's a whole
bunch of movie titles inside of it.

[00:51:47] **Adam Argyle:** They're focusable. You know, you've already done the
work where like you can keyboard in, but the bummer is, is when you keyboard in,
you have to keyboard past 25 titles before you can get down to comedy underneath
horror. Enter the CSS carousel feature spec. So right now you've [00:52:00] got
like a scroll snapping, horizontal scroller.

[00:52:02] **Adam Argyle:** You can, with a CSS selector target scroll buttons
on there and give them, , content just like a pseudo element and they appear. So
you can put a custom icon inside of this scroll button. And now you have scroll
buttons that appear next to. Your scroller, you can use anchor positioning to
put them inside the scroller, outside the scroller, up on top, down below,
together on the right, together on the left, together in the middle, whatever
you want.

[00:52:25] **Adam Argyle:** It's like the world's your oyster. So you're
already, now you have scroll buttons, right? And they're accessible. They do all
the things where they fade in and out when

[00:52:31] **Adam Argyle:** you're at the beginning and

[00:52:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** accessibility when I think you should

[00:52:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** highlight that that the point isn't visual when
it's accessibility. I think we have to get behind that

[00:52:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Like, even if you for some reason This sounds like
it does a lot of shit already. But if for some reason you wanted it to look a
little different, you should still use Like the stuff that you're is accessible
and the way to do it like all the right elements and everything And then just
restyle a little bit if you want that because if you do

[00:52:55] **Adam Argyle:** So that's the browser is going to

[00:52:57] **Robbie Wagner:** No one can use it.

[00:52:58] **Adam Argyle:** focusable. Yeah, [00:53:00] that all the work is
there and then you just get to come and install it. So here's even the things
like when you make a carousel, do the buttons go before the focusable content or
after it? And what if you have little markers at the bottom, the little dots or
thumbnails, do the buttons focus order after or before that?

[00:53:14] **Adam Argyle:** What if you don't want to give a shit because you
don't have any fucks to give, then you just say, Hey browser, Stick it in the
right place because I don't want to deal with this. I don't want my library to
have to deal

[00:53:23] **Robbie Wagner:** What is the

[00:53:24] **Robbie Wagner:** right do you know the right What's

[00:53:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** What's the default place?

[00:53:28] **Adam Argyle:** I think it's after, but honestly, yeah, I don't
remember. It's gone back and forth a lot. And so that's kind of the thing is
there's like a, why are you like WAI, ARIA patterns and they've got like advice
on it. but that's kind of one of the things it's like, we're kind of taking all
of the advice that we can and we're building that into the Chrome reports it
accurately to screen readers and so your accessibility tree is accurate per what
all the stuff is in there.

[00:53:49] **Adam Argyle:** and we're going to do all the ahead of time work so
that this thing can just Do the right thing for you out of, but you don't have
to worry about what comes first. , we'll make sure it's the right thing, but
yeah, the second feature after buttons is the markers at the bottom. So
[00:54:00] dots, it'll make a little dot or a number or a title, like for tabs,
like for sections or thumbnails for every scroll snap child or other things.

[00:54:09] **Adam Argyle:** It doesn't even have to be the thing that snaps. You
can just target any child and be like, generate a marker for this. And it'll be
like, okay. And it puts them all in group for you and another pseudo element
that you could use anchor positioning and put it on top, put it on the bottom,
turn them into boxes, turn them into squares, turn them into the whole thing.

[00:54:25] **Adam Argyle:** The world's your oyster. It's really exciting. And
then your arrow keys work inside of there. You tab in your arrows work. It's the
whole nine is all in there. And we have. the ability to toggle inertness from
CSS. So it's called interactivity colon inert, which was previously a HTML only
feature, and it was an attribute and it nullified the entire tree.

[00:54:44] **Adam Argyle:** You put it somewhere in the tree, just bam, every
child forever is inert. There's no focusing anything inside of there,

[00:54:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** So this is an HTML specific thing, or this is a

[00:54:54] **Adam Argyle:** This one's a CSS one. So the CSS is going to be able
to more

[00:54:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** it is.

[00:54:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** [00:55:00] CSS kind of taking accessibility to a
degree is an interesting

[00:55:04] **Adam Argyle:** It already was with display none versus visibility.
And yeah, I mean, that's kind of one of the things is a lot of people push back
and they're like, so you said shouldn't have to do with accessibility. And we're
like, it already does. You can change the color of the text to white on a white
background.

[00:55:16] **Adam Argyle:** It's now illegible. Um, there's like Oh, right.
Yeah, because the fallacy is that accessibility only has to do with like blind
people or deaf people and you're not, yeah, there's a

[00:55:27] **Robbie Wagner:** It's a huge, huge range of

[00:55:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's true. That's a great point. have two
questions. One, what's up with that shirt where it looks like CSS like in a
skateboard font or some shit?

[00:55:37] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah, this is from project Wallace. They do a CSS
insights and he's made a really sick shirt. And I was like, well, I must wear
it. I think he also made it from CSS day where I MC'd and I kind of did a, I
didn't mean to, I was just trying to get people pumped, but I was like, CSS,
CSS. And I did this like cheering thing.

[00:55:53] **Adam Argyle:** And then it kind of sounded really culty at one
point when people weren't cheering with me and I think this shirt is inspired
[00:56:00] by that. I don't Also,

[00:56:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** do you own not black shirts?

[00:56:04] **Adam Argyle:** No. One I've won it's black and green checkered. I
just got it's from packs was special. And then I look like a lumberjack.

[00:56:13] **Adam Argyle:** It's my, I have one lumberjack shirt and that's it.
It's a nerd pack

[00:56:16] **Adam Argyle:** shirt.

[00:56:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** black and green isn't a buffalo check. I don't
know, maybe it is, I guess, but it's not traditional. There's no maple syrup

[00:56:23] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah. I'm like Doug from, uh, you know, like I, I
got like a very simple wardrobe. That's all, all black teas, black pants. I have
like one. Yeah.

[00:56:33] **Robbie Wagner:** I tried that for a while. had a lot of the same
things. I still have a lot. I have like the same pants, I've like five of the
same pants, but I've stopped trying to do the shirts. I just have like, 'cause I
wanna wear, like I have the syntax shirt, I have like some of our shirts. I have
like. There's a bunch of different colored stuff, and can't do that, but I loved
the simplicity of like, you know, you basically wear the same thing all the
time, and it's like, Is that the same thing he wore yesterday? I'm not sure,
[00:57:00] but I'm not going to ask. Like,

[00:57:02] **Adam Argyle:** Yep. It's easy for everybody.

[00:57:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** Easy as easy. Turns out.

[00:57:08] **Robbie Wagner:** I do have a question about like, you know, we
dropped all that about the CSS carousel stuff and like, you know, accessibility
and whatever. I still feel like, and I haven't,

[00:57:18] **Robbie Wagner:** you know, I, well,

[00:57:21] **Adam Argyle:** I feel like chicken tonight. Oh, that's what, sorry.

[00:57:25] **Robbie Wagner:** I feel like no one gives accessibility or CSS or
most of the time, HTML, like the time of day at all, like back to the JavaScript
or CSS thing, I feel like there's so

[00:57:38] **Robbie Wagner:** much new stuff coming out in CSS that I can't
possibly learn at all without

[00:57:42] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:57:42] **Adam Argyle:** neither.

[00:57:43] **Robbie Wagner:** like, I feel like college should have a course on
just CSS.

[00:57:47] **Robbie Wagner:** Like, they try to do, like, you know, a web dev
course, and that's like, alright, well, we'll tell you what CSS is, but then you
can figure it out. I feel like we're at the point where there's so much in CSS,
it should be its own course. [00:58:00] So,

[00:58:00] **Robbie Wagner:** I, think we should do that, and I think, uh, we
can all teach it.

[00:58:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** want an addendum upon that for post college
professionals, which is like We've, uh, gone back and rubber banded around like
there was a separation of concerns and they used to be like subject matter
experts along like different levels of it. So it would be like designers kind of
do HTML as well so they could structure the document correctly and maybe they
know a little CSS but the front end devs know the advanced CSS and we can get
there.

[00:58:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then they know some JavaScript and then
like. We're getting our JSON APIs and then like it all kind of comes together.
And now that has like heavily leaned towards the application logic in the
browser. So now we've forgotten about, oh, becoming CSS experts because now, you
know, tailwind solves it for us.

[00:58:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** And does to a degree, but that abstraction,
like, kind of [00:59:00] takes away some of that developed expertise, and
companies aren't prioritizing it. And I think in that, and a lack of, semantic
HTML being a first class citizen anymore means that, accessibility has been
thrown out the window.

[00:59:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** that I think is a massive problem.

[00:59:18] **Adam Argyle:** Yep. These things are hard. There's been a couple,
couple of people have said some really profound things for me over past couple
of years. One of them was, uh, someone was writing, Oh crap. It's like a
procedural code. I think it starts with P. What's this language? it's very low
level.

[00:59:32] **Adam Argyle:** Dang it. This wasn't supposed to be a quiz.

[00:59:34] **Adam Argyle:** Uh, anyway, this person

[00:59:35] **Adam Argyle:** was like, if you can,

[00:59:37] **Adam Argyle:** oh, not Pascal, but it's Good. Good. the answer.

[00:59:40] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, sure. Sure. That sounds like it. That's a great,
that usually works, right? Mm hmm. It's been working for me, clearly.

[00:59:46] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm trying to think of any other languages to
start with P.

[00:59:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** Pee

[00:59:50] **Adam Argyle:** It starts with an A, it's assembly. Hey, it worked.
I took a ha ha this person's like, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. possibly.

[00:59:57] **Adam Argyle:** Gotcha, gotcha.

[00:59:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** [01:00:00] Yeah.

[01:00:00] **Adam Argyle:** but yeah, this person's like I've, I've been writing
assembly. I'm trying to, I'm teaching these courses on a blah, blah, blah. And
he's like, I want you to go write a CSS grid the other day. My God, it's way
harder than assembly. He's like some of the hardest problems that I'm solving in
assembly, are half as difficult as a responsive grid layout.

[01:00:16] **Adam Argyle:** And I was like, I love that this person said that.
So then another person says they've been building, , native apps. That's pretty
much how they cut their teeth where a lot of us cut our teeth early web or web
centric in general. Anyway, this person is transitioning into the web. And, uh,
they're obviously a talented, software engineer because they're building native
apps, which is basically, those have been typed since the beginning, right?

[01:00:36] **Adam Argyle:** These are, these are real apps get compiled into
little executables. Anyway. So this person is transitioning into the web and
after all, so they are a good scripter, but what they're learning is that HTML
is the hardest language. They're like, basically, this is like a seasoned
engineer saying. I'm still learning HTML every day.

[01:00:55] **Adam Argyle:** I think this is because it's so many subjective
choices that I have to make where [01:01:00] scripting doesn't have the
subjective choices. CSS deals with more than just subjective choices. It deals
with multiple consumers of various size, of various capability, of various, all
these things.

[01:01:10] **Adam Argyle:** And CSS is thrashed around in the most chaotic space
that's ever existed. And HTML is in the same scenario where we're all consuming
this thing. And we have high expectations So it's like, this guy's like, I'm
coming from native. Looking at JavaScript is easy. HTML is hard. Why aren't
y'all focusing on it more?

[01:01:26] **Adam Argyle:** Why isn't there more education about HTML and CSS?
This shit is super duper hard. And I'm just listening. I'm like, I love that
this person is willing to say that because that's not the common phrase. On the
web, we all generally be like I made the color red with color red. this shit is
easy And i'm like, oh, yeah Well yesterday I combined a time-based animation
with the scroll-based animation so that they could both affect the same
Transform value without stomping on each other's feet.

[01:01:50] **Adam Argyle:** What the fuck did you Oh you made

[01:01:53] **Adam Argyle:** The

[01:01:53] **Adam Argyle:** color red Oh That's really nice

[01:01:55] **Adam Argyle:** of

[01:01:55] **Adam Argyle:** you

[01:01:55] **Adam Argyle:** That's really

[01:01:55] **Adam Argyle:** cool

[01:01:56] **Adam Argyle:** You made the color red anyway,

[01:01:57] **Adam Argyle:** but it's like this wild disrespect for [01:02:00]
this thing, because of just almost like the way you write it, like the
declarative nature, the fact that it starts with declarative immediately makes
people think it's not powerful.

[01:02:09] **Adam Argyle:** It's just like this strange thing that our
communities continue to do and our educational systems and our own companies
continue to do, even though they were all playing a part to make an airplane
together. It doesn't matter who is doing like, okay. It does matter though at a
software company. They're like, Oh, you just paint the plane.

[01:02:25] **Adam Argyle:** Oh, that's actually just kind of, and I'm like,
well, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I just, cause I write CSS doesn't mean I just
walk up and fucking paint the plane, dude. Like you're completely
misunderstanding. They actually just stacked all of the chairs for me inside the
main hole. I had to write a layout to put all the chairs in the right spot with
the right gaps that have to do with user expectations and make sure that the eye
level is at the TVs, man.

[01:02:47] **Adam Argyle:** I'm like, you cannot just call me the painter of the
plane. This is really rude. Anyways, I keep going. I'm going

[01:02:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think

[01:02:52] **Adam Argyle:** because your finger's

[01:02:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** a drink real quick. And I would say that CSS is
both declarative and imperative. And the second thing is [01:03:00] CSS is the
punk rock of web development. You

[01:03:05] **Adam Argyle:** I'm so happy to hear you say that.

[01:03:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** know why? Because it's like the whole three
chord Monty bullshit with like whatever, like punk rock is so simple because
it's like basic chords and

[01:03:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** thrashing away and whatever else and tell people
really dive into it.

[01:03:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** So.

[01:03:20] **Adam Argyle:** This is a good point. Yeah. On the surface, it seems
extremely simple, but then you're like, cool. You go do it. , great. I'll talk
to you when you're all done making your first punk album.

[01:03:29] **Robbie Wagner:** I think if you were like, you know, hey, make this
like Out of just like one div and CSS, make like a transformer versus give me a
sorting algorithm. There's one that you can probably figure out a lot easier
than the other. And like, I'll just leave it at that.

[01:03:47] **Adam Argyle:** so it's like, there's other industries where like
building homes, The electricians and the architects, everybody sort of seems to
have more of a mutual respect for each other. And the web doesn't do that for
some reason. We have a [01:04:00] hierarchy like this, like weird and we
continue it.

[01:04:01] **Adam Argyle:** , we could destroy it at any day that we wanted to,
we could destroy this hierarchy of bullshit and just say that we're all equal
participants in building web experiences, but we're not, people want to feel
better than other people. there's like this is like born in our, blood and yeah.

[01:04:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think a decade ago this happened very
strongly. I mean, I have been a part of that. I've been on teams where the front
end is perceived as being like, make it pretty and simple. And I feel like that
rubber band effect is where we're at now.

[01:04:32] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah, the front end has come back to show that it's,
you can't take It lightly and it's your one place to basically distinguish
yourself. , I like to tell people it's like getting in a car. let's say I'm
going to go try three cars. , one car has the dopest engine in the entire world.
, the other one has, , amazing range. but it's, uh, kind of crappy inside. And
the third one's like somehow a middle of all of them, but in the interior is
very nice. I'm like, I'm going to get in the one with the nice interior and
basically be like, this is, I'm, I'm [01:05:00] sitting in this for long rides.
I'm sitting there, right?

[01:05:01] **Adam Argyle:** This is what I'm going to do. This is the one I
want. the fastest engine doesn't always win, but that's, we're just so obsessed
with that for some reason. making things comfy is hard, making things beautiful
and comfortable. It takes iteration and love. It takes love Love is all you need
to write good CSS

[01:05:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hehe. I wish we were doing that

[01:05:24] **Robbie Wagner:** I did miss out on the, uh, the HTML is for lovers
sticker that on

[01:05:29] **Robbie Wagner:** rehab. I need to get one. of those. Oh, you

[01:05:30] **Robbie Wagner:** got

[01:05:31] **Robbie Wagner:** one.

[01:05:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** one. Yeah, it's on my, I have two stickers on my
computer right now because I was, I did not grab our own stickers. Apparently I
only grabbed one. And so I have, uh, HTML is for lovers. I love that one. And
then I have the wet whiskey web and whatnot, but it's like in a soccer crest.

[01:05:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then it says the Ryan Reynolds, , fan club,
cause that's like kind of a

[01:05:55] **Robbie Wagner:** I can show you right now

[01:05:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, sure.

[01:05:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** [01:06:00] do

[01:06:00] **Robbie Wagner:** right?

[01:06:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** focus. It was. Oh, it's coming back.

[01:06:03] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah.

[01:06:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** to get jerseys made with that crest on it. I
think that would be dope, so we'll see.

[01:06:09] **Adam Argyle:** I like it.

[01:06:10] **Adam Argyle:** Anyway, thanks for letting me rant. I ranted a
couple times pretty furiously. You could just call me Furiosa, the web Furiosa.
, but yeah, like I really think that the fact that we're competing against each
other, It's like, why the hell are we doing that? We're all like, the way that
we all win is if people use our shit.

[01:06:25] **Adam Argyle:** So it's like, how about we all focus on making
usable shit. And that does mean accessibility because that it just drives me
nuts when people can't consider themselves when they're even temporarily
disabled. And it's like, almost like you're, we're all temporarily abled. We all
feel, especially as you get older, you feel this, you fall down and you get a
big fat bruise or you do something stupid.

[01:06:43] **Adam Argyle:** And you're like, holy shit, I'm vulnerable.

[01:06:46] **Adam Argyle:** I don't like this at all.

[01:06:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[01:06:48] **Adam Argyle:** it was strong, but i'm fragile. , and so it's like
why can't we think back to that more about how like the way that we want this, I
don't know. It just seems seems strange and self servient in a [01:07:00] lot of
ways and a lot of people Well, a lot of people also care more about their career
trajectory than they do producing actually something good So that's also
something so it's like those people are going to do what it takes to it's like,

[01:07:11] **Adam Argyle:** okay, that is just on a different, different

[01:07:14] **Adam Argyle:** meteor than I am.

[01:07:14] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah.

[01:07:15] **Robbie Wagner:** accessibility should be a should improve your
career. Like it should be, , like, I feel like that should be a thing anyone
could do. If you come into a new app and you're like, Oh yeah, this is not
accessible, you know, pitch to your boss that like, Hey, this should be
accessible.

[01:07:29] **Robbie Wagner:** Not just because like, you know, for. These
certain people or whatever, just like , from even just a usability standpoint of
like using, like we talked about, like, you know, the native HTML solution
versus like thousands of lines of JavaScript is going to load quicker for people
that can see and click and do whatever. you should always go with the simple,
like standards based solution and doing that and improving your load times,
improving who can use it. Unblocking people that you may not have known you were
blocking

[01:07:59] **Robbie Wagner:** [01:08:00] should always be like Yeah should
should always like make you increase your career Like I mean, that's it probably
won't because of this such a political game and like I don't even know how you
get promoted I'm, never gonna figure it out.

[01:08:13] **Robbie Wagner:** It seems like so, uh, You know, but I that's how I
feel that it should help but it maybe maybe doesn't maybe that's a idealized
world

[01:08:22] **Adam Argyle:** stinking world. I mean, our votes just came in,
right? We just, our country voted for someone. I was like, Whoa, I did not
expect that. But it's the same reason why I'm like, Whoa, JavaScript got 10
million for that JavaScript library project bundler thing. Holy shit. Why didn't
they do that for CSS? I'll never know.

[01:08:36] **Adam Argyle:** These are questions I cannot answer with my tiny,
tiny CSS brain.

[01:08:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** Your inability to pitch to VCs. Maybe that's the
problem. I don't know. It's hard to say. Wherever it comes from. It doesn't come
out of nowhere. I think people seek money and find ways to get it.

[01:08:54] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah,

[01:08:54] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Maybe, maybe we need more, uh, just slap
some AI labels on CSS initiatives and that'll get [01:09:00] some money. Yeah.

[01:09:01] **Adam Argyle:** keep trying to, I've been training my own Gemini
bot, internally for months now trying to make an actually good CSS AI bot.
That's for vanilla. It's not gonna be a tail with it. There's already plenty of
tailwinds suggesting AI bots. Um,

[01:09:14] **Adam Argyle:** and it's really

[01:09:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** gives you components with CSS. Shad

[01:09:18] **Adam Argyle:** Yeah. Shad and tailwind. Yeah. Which is smart. ,
it's just like, you, you, it makes sense why the AI, you know, Engines are so
shitty at CSS. Cause if you go search something just basic, how do I center this
