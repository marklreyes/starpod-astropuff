[00:00:17] **Robbie Wagner:** No, all right, they didn't have original flavor
the reason I have to do this is our fantasy football league if you get a zero
You have to chug an ice per zero you get

[00:00:27] **Robbie Wagner:** so I owe two So i'm just going to do them live

[00:00:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Well, while you start doing that Yeah, he
What?

[00:00:37] **Ken Wheeler:** Like, Bros Icing Bros. Like,

[00:00:39] **Chris Power:** Hell

[00:00:39] **Chris Power:** yeah. So you got, you had a lineup that scored two
zeros.

[00:00:45] **Robbie Wagner:** No, okay,

[00:00:46] **Robbie Wagner:** I, I've

[00:00:46] **Chris Power:** Are you a manager in real

[00:00:48] **Robbie Wagner:** throughout the whole season. The one was, stupid
because this last one, they called him out like 10 minutes before the game.
Like,

[00:00:57] **Robbie Wagner:** I wasn't paying enough attention. Yeah.

[00:00:59] **Chris Power:** [00:01:00] the worst.

[00:01:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't know anything about Eggball Game, but
today's episode is brought to you by Dark Hedges Iris Whiskey. I don't know how
this felt like on brand. It is, uh, finished, yeah, it is 80 proof. It is
finished in rum casks. Of course, the fine folks at Total Wine were like, that's
a great one. I was like, nah, 30 bucks, we'll see.

[00:01:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** I know, I never trust them, because you know,
like, they'll be incentivized to try to sell certain inventory

[00:01:26] **Chris Power:** They had a meeting that morning. they had a meeting
that morning. They're like, we got to move some dark hedges. We

[00:01:30] **Chris Power:** got to move them. We got too many.

[00:01:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** You would think, like, this bright ass box would
actually get people's attention. They'd be like, pfft, look at that. I mean,
rum, Irish whiskey

[00:01:39] **Robbie Wagner:** Looks like A a parking hang tag.

[00:01:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** little bit,

[00:01:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah.

[00:01:44] **Robbie Wagner:** you're going to an event and you put That in

[00:01:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. So, anyway, that's what I got going on
today.

[00:01:50] **Chris Power:** I have something that was left over. It's lightly
used.

[00:01:55] **Chris Power:** Not too many miles. It's only highway miles. Barrel
[00:02:00] Vantage. Which someone brought over my house and it's pretty good.
So, that's what I'm having. That's why I chose it.

[00:02:04] **Robbie Wagner:** The more of it you drink, do you have a better
view? Is that why they call it Vantage?

[00:02:08] **Chris Power:** It's true. Yep. Exactly. Dude's

[00:02:15] **Ken Wheeler:** As And that's a normal sized bottle, Ken just has
really big hands.

[00:02:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, he's, uh, he's bigger in real life. It's
weird.

[00:02:22] **Ken Wheeler:** Am I?

[00:02:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** no, I'd say you're probably about the size I
expected. I mean, from the waist up at least.

[00:02:29] **Chris Power:** You know who's big in real life? Wait, stop. You
know, it's bigger in real life than I expected. I'm a pretty tall guy. I'm like
6'4 ish, pretty big guy. But,

[00:02:40] **Chris Power:** um, I met, uh, Theo.

[00:02:44] **Ken Wheeler:** Theo's fucking tall

[00:02:45] **Ken Wheeler:** as

[00:02:45] **Chris Power:** I met Theo recently. He is so tall.

[00:02:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** What's his real name though?

[00:02:54] **Robbie Wagner:** [00:03:00] Yeah

[00:03:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** Theo seems

[00:03:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** like one I could do, like, like, you could do
that, like, in the order in which they've done it, like, Oh, you know, I'm gonna
just make believe fucking name, and then, you know, alright, here's my real
name, I'm gonna go by the real name.

[00:03:11] **Ken Wheeler:** But you can never go, like, real name, and then be
like, Hey, you guys gotta call me the Punisher now.

[00:03:16] **Ken Wheeler:** Like,

[00:03:19] **Chris Power:** The Punisher now.

[00:03:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, that

[00:03:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** would I go by Nighthawk, thank you.

[00:03:23] **Ken Wheeler:** They're like, oh shit, Ken Wheeler, I'm like, yo,
whoa, whoa, whoa, easy on the docks.

[00:03:26] **Ken Wheeler:** Like, Like,

[00:03:29] **Ken Wheeler:** Like,

[00:03:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** have an internet name that I used for, like,

[00:03:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** forums and all of that stuff. You know, internet
soon. It was Junior McBride. Which no one will get.

[00:03:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** Except for us.

[00:03:39] **Robbie Wagner:** tell the story chip.

[00:03:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** Tell of what it is? So it's one of the
characters from a 70's porn called Taboo 2 and the premise was it was like an
incestuous family, not only incest, but that was like the end goal.

[00:03:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** Like they were like a very, I don't know,
sexually strained family [00:04:00] of four, you know, and there's a son and
daughter and they go out and do their crazy seventies things. You know, go out
to the bush, literally, and then come back, and in the end, the big, like,
crescendo of the film is that son and mom and dad and daughter get to lay it
down, and then brother sister do it.

[00:04:23] **Chris Power:** that's a good one. I would say my favorite Christmas

[00:04:25] **Chris Power:** movie.

[00:04:26] **Robbie Wagner:** who it was

[00:04:26] **Ken Wheeler:** is junior

[00:04:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** His name is Junior McBride, is the son, and it's
really funny because, like, towards the beginning of the film, he goes over to
help, like, a family friend or something fix something, Oh, good to see you,
Junior, and then she kind of glances down, because it's 70s, like, tight pants,
and she says, uh, although you don't look like a Junior to me.

[00:04:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** Very funny.

[00:04:48] **Chris Power:** So it's a coming it's a coming of age

[00:04:49] **Ken Wheeler:** you a

[00:04:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes, yes, literal figurative way.

[00:04:52] **Ken Wheeler:** Are you a vintage porno guy?

[00:04:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** no, not really. I had roommates in college and
after, and some of them were very much [00:05:00] into it, and sometimes it
would be like you're hanging out and like, this is a hilarious 70s porn, you
just like watch that for entertainment.

[00:05:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't know.

[00:05:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:05:09] **Ken Wheeler:** all sat in a room together

[00:05:09] **Ken Wheeler:** in

[00:05:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** heh heh. Yeah, yeah.

[00:05:15] **Ken Wheeler:** Okay.

[00:05:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, I don't know. And then we circle
jerked each other off. It was like, isn't that how it goes? Is that not how your
college experience was? You know.

[00:05:26] **Chris Power:** So we had, yeah, we had a fun little get together
once where, um, we did a Yankee swap and somebody, somebody got

[00:05:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** Like candles,

[00:05:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** or

[00:05:33] **Chris Power:** Yankee swap as,

[00:05:35] **Chris Power:** as a.

[00:05:35] **Robbie Wagner:** mean?

[00:05:37] **Chris Power:** Oh, what's it called? Oh, maybe this is like a
regional name. like secret Santa, but it's like you get whatever gift you get.

[00:05:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, like White Elephant, or

[00:05:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** whatever.

[00:05:44] **Chris Power:** it's not secret Santa.

[00:05:45] **Chris Power:** It's Yankee swap where you, uh, you pick up a gift
and then like the next person goes, they could steal your gift

[00:05:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** Like White Elephant,

[00:05:52] **Ken Wheeler:** I've heard of this. Somebody, like, tried playing
it,

[00:05:53] **Ken Wheeler:** but

[00:05:54] **Ken Wheeler:** it,

[00:05:54] **Ken Wheeler:** like, fell apart.

[00:05:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, White Elephant is another

[00:05:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** one.

[00:05:56] **Chris Power:** White elephant. We always call it Yankee swap,

[00:05:59] **Chris Power:** yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's a [00:06:00]
Massachusetts thing. I don't know. But

[00:06:01] **Chris Power:** someone. Got a magazine called all Bush and it came
with a DVD.

[00:06:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh my

[00:06:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** gosh.

[00:06:09] **Chris Power:** happened to put the DVD in this, in the DVD player.
And let's just say my brother's wife got very mad,

[00:06:15] **Chris Power:** threw it away.

[00:06:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right. Yeah. . That is good. if I had a DVD
player, I would figure out a way to make that

[00:06:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** joke.

[00:06:23] **Ken Wheeler:** I have

[00:06:23] **Chris Power:** That was, you know,

[00:06:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** you got one left? One DVD or just player?

[00:06:27] **Ken Wheeler:** One, one Xbox that accepts DVDs.

[00:06:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:06:31] **Ken Wheeler:** And that's, that's solely responsible, so if
somebody gives me a DVD I was in, uh, in New York, and they were trying to hand
me CDs, and I'm like, What the fuck am I gonna do with this? I'm

[00:06:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's it.

[00:06:41] **Chris Power:** it's a QR code to download

[00:06:42] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, give me a fucking SoundCloud QR code,

[00:06:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right, exactly. That's a lot cheaper to produce,
too. You don't have to go burning, like, a hundred CDs,

[00:06:51] **Ken Wheeler:** CD Rs, the fat stack.

[00:06:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Mm hmm. Mm. So I have a floppy disk that I need
to, uh, I don't need, but it would be [00:07:00] very interesting. I have HDMX
V2, , and it's on a floppy disk. Yeah, it's like Golden Monkey Edition or
whatever. Yeah, apparently it's really on there, but I have no way to

[00:07:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** verify.

[00:07:13] **Ken Wheeler:** So I have a vintage drum machine.

[00:07:15] **Ken Wheeler:** and it takes 3. 5 inch floppies.

[00:07:18] **Ken Wheeler:** That's what it'll like store the samples on.

[00:07:21] **Ken Wheeler:** Um, it's currently broken, pending a chip
replacement. However, I have its. Next one right there and that takes those fat
like flash cards remember

[00:07:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** Mmm. Mm hmm. Uh, what were those called? Like
zip drives or something?

[00:07:35] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, well, Yeah, no there were there were jazz
drives for the

[00:07:37] **Ken Wheeler:** other one

[00:07:38] **Ken Wheeler:** and then

[00:07:39] **Ken Wheeler:** now I have the new one And this fucking thing is
just all on board like micro SD shit

[00:07:45] **Chris Power:** damn, that's so cool.

[00:07:47] **Ken Wheeler:** But yeah, it's funny the old one it's all saved onto
a floppy disk and it's got like

[00:07:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** You know, if I have a hundred of

[00:07:54] **Ken Wheeler:** which is awesome.

[00:07:55] **Ken Wheeler:** It's a good fidelity. It's like it's like the
sampling where it's like

[00:07:58] **Chris Power:** it's good that warm.

[00:07:59] **Ken Wheeler:** low bit rate kind [00:08:00] of That kind of deal

[00:08:04] **Chris Power:** like midi. Am I thinking of it wrong?

[00:08:06] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, it's midi, um, but it's also on board like
analog too like

[00:08:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** hmm.

[00:08:11] **Ken Wheeler:** it can be used as a mini controller

[00:08:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm not buying another thing, Ken. Sorry.

[00:08:15] **Chris Power:** Mm hmm.

[00:08:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** a little MIDI keyboard and I've got the, teenage
engineering thing.

[00:08:21] **Ken Wheeler:** But do you have the smallest npc of all

[00:08:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** ,

[00:08:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:08:24] **Chris Power:** Oh, that's

[00:08:25] **Ken Wheeler:** It's actually a, uh, it's a Teenage Engineering, KO.

[00:08:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hmm.

[00:08:29] **Ken Wheeler:** Wrapped in a NPC skin. It's, very much Teenage
Engineering under the hood. Too much fun. How does this man get anything done
throughout the day with all

[00:08:40] **Ken Wheeler:** these

[00:08:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, exactly. You know, Do you have to make
music for work? I know you can't really talk about work.

[00:08:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:08:48] **Ken Wheeler:** Fuck no. That shit is the farthest shit from making
music imaginable.

[00:08:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** React class components. They don't make music.
You could maybe

[00:08:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** though. Yeah.

[00:08:58] **Ken Wheeler:** components.

[00:08:59] **Chris Power:** Did too I

[00:08:59] **Chris Power:** [00:09:00] miss them I still miss them

[00:09:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Classes

[00:09:02] **Ken Wheeler:** everybody says is wrong. Fucking, I like using this.
I like fucking putting shit on the window. I don't give a fuck, man.

[00:09:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** All right, yeah. Global scope. I mean, come on.
We've got global this now. I mean, we've got some guardrails. So what's, you
know, why is it terrible? Perhaps it's not.

[00:09:17] **Robbie Wagner:** It was never bad. You just have to change stuff so
that people have to use the new stuff.

[00:09:21] **Robbie Wagner:** And so that you can

[00:09:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** what, well, here's the thing. We're just like,
we're still bitching about this, but apparently React has had hooks longer than
it hadn't now. I think I saw something that they came out in like 2019. And so,
at this point, and React was like yeah, like 2014, so it's like five years with,
five years , after, but I guess we're like skewing on the after side now.

[00:09:43] **Chris Power:** yeah, Twitter disagrees, but like, I just can't I
don't know I just can't think of a, worse abstraction than going from the class
components system with lifecycle hooks and all that good stuff to hooks, which
is just like functions running and like, if you just, if you forget to put the
[00:10:00] right, the right, dependencies in your hook, , you know, the
dependency array.

[00:10:03] **Chris Power:** Whoops. It's going to run a million times a second.

[00:10:05] **Ken Wheeler:** Even if you put the right ones in sometimes.

[00:10:08] **Chris Power:** Yeah.

[00:10:08] **Chris Power:** Yep.

[00:10:09] **Ken Wheeler:** Have you ever seen movie or GIF where it's like,
somebody throws a ping pong ball at all these strategically placed plates, and
it bounces from one to the other to the other to the other to the other?

[00:10:20] **Chris Power:** Mm

[00:10:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:10:21] **Robbie Wagner:** I can imagine what you're saying.

[00:10:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** but I've

[00:10:24] **Ken Wheeler:** That's what, cause like, you know, in a sufficiently
complex component, right?

[00:10:27] **Ken Wheeler:** Like, you have, like, oh, well, uh, if this changes,
then change this. And then if that changes, then change this, right? And the
whole thing's like, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft. And, you're like, wait,
hold on, wait, wait a second, fucking, we're in dev, so that ran this fucking
thing twice, and it used to be easier to reason about.

[00:10:44] **Chris Power:** It's way more implicit, way more implicit now than
like when before it was like, you could just see it. Like you said, it's way
more, way more easier to reason about back when it was just class components and
lifecycle hooks. And yeah.

[00:10:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, and it's totally backwards. Like, you
shouldn't have to say what shouldn't re render. [00:11:00] It should not re
render by default. And then you should be like, This is the thing that should
change now, please. But

[00:11:05] **Robbie Wagner:** we don't do that, because like, That would be
hard.

[00:11:09] **Ken Wheeler:** Indeed it would.

[00:11:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** well, yeah, I think like an over inclusion of
state, maybe, as part of React is part of the problem, to a degree, in my view.

[00:11:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** too much high level state. That's probably like
one of the things that I do like about newer next stuff is that, , things are
very much being tied to like form actions and server actions and doing a little
more like state through the API layer, even though their API layer is a little,
I don't know, ish.

[00:11:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Depends on how much you want to do that, but
they are trying to cover the basis all the way server and back. It would seem
What would Rails do? Is that what you say?

[00:11:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** What

[00:11:52] **Chris Power:** Rails would

[00:11:53] **Chris Power:** do?

[00:11:53] **Chris Power:** it a lot different. I'm not a rails at home. Sorry.
Don't look at that.

[00:11:57] **Chris Power:** Don't

[00:11:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, exactly. That's not you.

[00:11:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** okay, [00:12:00] Ken, if you couldn't use
JavaScript ever again, what would you pick up?

[00:12:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** C++

[00:12:06] **Chris Power:** hell. Yeah.

[00:12:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** Nice.

[00:12:09] **Robbie Wagner:** No hesitation.

[00:12:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:12:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** Robbie and I had some talks where like C doesn't
seem bad. You know, a little NET C#ness It's not crazy.

[00:12:17] **Ken Wheeler:** You can't really

[00:12:18] **Ken Wheeler:** go wrong

[00:12:18] **Ken Wheeler:** with C right?

[00:12:20] **Ken Wheeler:** Like, obviously, like, I would say OCaml, right?
But, like, when I say C I say it for a reason.

[00:12:26] **Ken Wheeler:** and it's, you know, partially, like, if you want to
bread out, that's certainly possible there. And then also, like, culturally, I'd
use Rust, but,

[00:12:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Because

[00:12:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** you don't want to get in fights with people all
the time. Is that what it

[00:12:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** is?

[00:12:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** is

[00:12:42] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, C++ It's
about where I'd want to be.

[00:12:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hmm. Yeah, Yeah, it seems like some calm calmer
folks

[00:12:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** calmer

[00:12:51] **Ken Wheeler:** I don't know about Commer, but

[00:12:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** are always

[00:12:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** gonna

[00:12:55] **Ken Wheeler:** they're fighting you, at least they're fighting you
about the code.

[00:12:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, there's just like rtfm and that's
[00:13:00] it

[00:13:00] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I mean, NET is pretty good and like
Microsoft is one of the M's of Menomina, so,

[00:13:06] **Robbie Wagner:** you know, they're, they're

[00:13:07] **Ken Wheeler:** in what now

[00:13:08] **Chris Power:** Menominal.

[00:13:09] **Robbie Wagner:** this is the new thing. Fang is dead, it's Menomina
now.

[00:13:13] **Ken Wheeler:** thought it was Manga. It's Menomena now.

[00:13:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:13:16] **Robbie Wagner:** we've dictated this.

[00:13:18] **Robbie Wagner:** No one is

[00:13:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** We, mostly Robbie, but I'm going with it.

[00:13:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** I mean.

[00:13:22] **Chris Power:** spell it out. What's my

[00:13:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm glad you're a listener to the show.

[00:13:25] **Robbie Wagner:** Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft. I, can't, there's too
many letters. I'm

[00:13:31] **Robbie Wagner:** losing them all.

[00:13:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** Alphabet.

[00:13:33] **Robbie Wagner:** no, Airbnb, Alphabet, NVIDIA. and Anthropic.

[00:13:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, so the last A is what's been up for
debate, because it's like, yeah, you could say Airbnb, but like, they aren't,
Doing

[00:13:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** crazy

[00:13:46] **Robbie Wagner:** killing it as much anymore.

[00:13:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** No.

[00:13:48] **Ken Wheeler:** it the same or are they killing it less?

[00:13:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't know. That's a great question.

[00:13:52] **Chris Power:** you mean like how many people die in Airbnbs every
year?

[00:13:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** A lot. Yeah, you know, there's a ton of
competent. They're not printing money the way they did early on [00:14:00] which
they all.

[00:14:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I've,

[00:14:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** I've gone,

[00:14:03] **Ken Wheeler:** so fucking much.

[00:14:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** especially with a family, I've very much swung
the other way. I don't want to take out the fucking trash, I don't want to strip
the beds, I don't want a list of responsibilities for a 400 fucking cleaning fee
on top

[00:14:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** of

[00:14:15] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay,

[00:14:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** I want room

[00:14:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** service,

[00:14:17] **Robbie Wagner:** with a family then? Are you getting like multiple

[00:14:19] **Robbie Wagner:** room suite kind of deal?

[00:14:21] **Ken Wheeler:** But what about a

[00:14:21] **Ken Wheeler:** hotel, dude? a

[00:14:22] **Ken Wheeler:** hotel has a fucking iron. And they have a
television, and that's all I need.

[00:14:26] **Ken Wheeler:** And you jerk off and you say, clean it up. And it's

[00:14:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's true. Your comrades can go Right

[00:14:31] **Ken Wheeler:** Right on the fucking floor of the

[00:14:33] **Ken Wheeler:** bathroom.

[00:14:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** true. There's another aspect there. But yeah,
for us, I mean, our kids are five and eight. And we get a suite with, like,
separate rooms a little bit. And

[00:14:43] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah.

[00:14:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** it.

[00:14:44] **Chris Power:** that's the best.

[00:14:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** And the cost is

[00:14:46] **Ken Wheeler:** and we got two

[00:14:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah. Two connecting

[00:14:49] **Ken Wheeler:** like one bedroom. And

[00:14:51] **Ken Wheeler:** her

[00:14:51] **Ken Wheeler:** sister stayed with some of the kids. And

[00:14:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hmm. Well, yeah. Right.

[00:14:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, that would be fine. Yeah.

[00:14:57] **Chris Power:** Sounds lovely.

[00:14:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** Nothing wrong with that. [00:15:00] Yeah

[00:15:00] **Chris Power:** Hmm. Even if it's a little bit more, I think it's
like absolutely worth it for like, you know what you get from it, right?

[00:15:06] **Ken Wheeler:** Man, two in the morning, Eric, hey, what's going on?
Can you sign up some fucking guy? And they will.

[00:15:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, you

[00:15:11] **Chris Power:** it's like, for what? Don't worry about it. All
right. We'll send someone up.

[00:15:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** Love robes, too. That's what I like about hotels
is I want a robe. I want some slips I don't want to travel with that

[00:15:20] **Ken Wheeler:** I was at a really, really nice fucking hotel.

[00:15:23] **Ken Wheeler:** Like, really nice. Everything was really fucking
phenomenal. Like, I mean, you know. Unbe fucking lievable down in Miami. Like,
beautiful fucking hotel.

[00:15:30] **Chris Power:** Hell yeah.

[00:15:31] **Ken Wheeler:** And there weren't robes. I was taken back.

[00:15:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Did you call and ask for robes just in case cuz
I have had to do that a lot of places lately I'd be like, uh, I don't have any
robes here. You have those, right? And they're like, yeah, of course.

[00:15:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay,

[00:15:43] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, do you have these or am I leaving?

[00:15:45] **Ken Wheeler:** I'll never forget the, the,

[00:15:46] **Ken Wheeler:** the

[00:15:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** I get a refund

[00:15:48] **Ken Wheeler:** Best one.

[00:15:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** on this? Oh, wait. Let's see

[00:15:50] **Ken Wheeler:** Kemptons have good ones. That's for sure.

[00:15:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** I want to acknowledge, people are listening to
us, by the way.

[00:15:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** So Jacob would, , like to know, I would prefer
React if it wasn't so leaky. [00:16:00] I would like just using JSX and write my
logic in not React. I mean, there are other JSX frameworks,

[00:16:07] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, but JSX is trash, so I wouldn't recommend.

[00:16:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** just saying, if you'd like that, there are

[00:16:12] **Ken Wheeler:** In theory, you could transpile it to whatever you
want.

[00:16:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, this is my thing. I think I think everything
should have stayed at class components. And if you want to do this magic, just
change it on the backend. Just all that shit to like. Hooks and whatever. I
don't need to know that shit.

[00:16:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, here we go. Charles says, Airbnb, once a
beloved startup everyone wanted to become. Now the bane of every dad's trip
because the wife thought the view was worth the rules and the hassle. Yeah, no,
I've, I feel you. That has definitely

[00:16:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** happened a

[00:16:41] **Robbie Wagner:** I like Airbnb. I've had a bad experience, I think
once or twice, but like overall it's been good for

[00:16:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** I like it for groups. Like if you get like a big
house and you say you have like three couples or something like that, it tends
to work out pretty well.

[00:16:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Um,

[00:16:54] **Ken Wheeler:** hit or miss it is.

[00:16:56] **Ken Wheeler:** I've had great ones. I had one that was like 40
yards from the Eiffel Tower. It was fucking incredible. [00:17:00] We were
sitting there looking at this fucking thing. I'm like,

[00:17:02] **Ken Wheeler:** holy

[00:17:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** Croissant! You were like,

[00:17:04] **Ken Wheeler:** My whole entire family up in like Lake George.

[00:17:10] **Ken Wheeler:** Phenomenal. Amazing time. Another time I'm in
England with a bunch

[00:17:13] **Ken Wheeler:** of kids and the guy's trying to make me leave at one
in the morning because his neighbors are saying we were being loud. I'm like,
everyone in this house is sleeping right now. What are you talking about?

[00:17:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, prove

[00:17:22] **Ken Wheeler:** just didn't want this guy to have an Airbnb in the

[00:17:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, so they were just causing

[00:17:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** trouble

[00:17:27] **Ken Wheeler:** Which is fair. So my neighbors had an Airbnb. I'm
like, what the fuck are you doing?

[00:17:30] **Ken Wheeler:** Like,

[00:17:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah. let me know if your neighbor does
start an Airbnb, cause I'm gonna rent it and like, throw a big party

[00:17:36] **Ken Wheeler:** you should.

[00:17:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** not invite you though.

[00:17:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** Just to

[00:17:38] **Ken Wheeler:** gonna fucking come lean over the fence. Chaz!

[00:17:48] **Chris Power:** I have Qua

[00:17:49] **Chris Power:** home.

[00:17:53] **Ken Wheeler:** A croissant or a question?

[00:17:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** how

[00:17:56] **Chris Power:** I have, I have a qua home. Do you

[00:17:58] **Chris Power:** want a

[00:17:58] **Chris Power:** qua

[00:17:58] **Ken Wheeler:** Do you know what I did today? It was [00:18:00]
actually reprehensible.

[00:18:01] **Ken Wheeler:** So apparently the McRib isn't out here until like
the third or something.

[00:18:04] **Ken Wheeler:** But somebody had a McRib. I think

[00:18:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I saw Annie

[00:18:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** had it

[00:18:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** on

[00:18:07] **Ken Wheeler:** So, uh, I made a McRib at home. I had extra ribs
left over from that barbecue high tea the other night.

[00:18:12] **Ken Wheeler:** I made the bun, because I didn't have a suitable
McRib bun

[00:18:17] **Ken Wheeler:** on deck. So I made the bun. Sliced up pickles and
everything. It was obscene.

[00:18:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oof,

[00:18:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, a homemade McRib would fuckin rock,

[00:18:27] **Ken Wheeler:** It was a real homemade McRib, I tell

[00:18:29] **Ken Wheeler:** you

[00:18:29] **Ken Wheeler:** what.

[00:18:30] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:18:30] **Robbie Wagner:** do think the, the barbecue high tea is something
we should market. Like we should just open places that do that. Like I would go
to that.

[00:18:39] **Ken Wheeler:** Right?

[00:18:40] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:18:41] **Ken Wheeler:** If I had more on hand, and the platter was a little
bit larger, we could have done like some, some burnt ends, and fucking other
accoutrements.

[00:18:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, when are you gonna, uh, start runnin React
New Jersey?

[00:18:54] **Ken Wheeler:** It really should.

[00:18:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Mm hmm, yeah, it needs, like, a fall
counterpart,

[00:18:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:18:59] **Ken Wheeler:** Well, [00:19:00] no, it needs a, there needs to be
a, um, dead in

[00:19:02] **Ken Wheeler:** the

[00:19:02] **Ken Wheeler:** middle of the summer in Jersey shore,

[00:19:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, on the shore. What town on the shore do
you like?

[00:19:08] **Ken Wheeler:** right now, Asbury?

[00:19:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hmm, I'm not familiar. I used to go to Wildwood
sometimes,

[00:19:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** and

[00:19:13] **Ken Wheeler:** Wildwood's like way down, Wildwood is like, so the
way that New Jersey works is, is that the top half is affiliated with New York
City, whereas the bottom half is affiliated with Philly.

[00:19:21] **Ken Wheeler:** So all the Philly people, the shoobies, they go to
fuckin Wildwood.

[00:19:24] **Ken Wheeler:** And then some of them trickle over to like, his
height is like, seaside. But, right after seaside, that's when you start running
into like, Point Pleasant, Manisquan, Belmar,

[00:19:33] **Ken Wheeler:** Asbury.

[00:19:34] **Ken Wheeler:** And that's all fuckin New York affiliated.

[00:19:37] **Ken Wheeler:** Right.

[00:19:37] **Ken Wheeler:** So we don't fuck

[00:19:38] **Ken Wheeler:** with

[00:19:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** ha ha.

[00:19:40] **Ken Wheeler:** brother went to, college down there.

[00:19:43] **Ken Wheeler:** And like, got all into like, Philly sports and shit.

[00:19:46] **Ken Wheeler:** Although I love Atlantic City, that's a fuckin good
time.

[00:19:47] **Ken Wheeler:** That's really, really, really good

[00:19:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** I haven't been there in a long

[00:19:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** time, but

[00:19:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** it

[00:19:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** was

[00:19:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** a fuckin dirt hole, , when I did briefly visit.
I had a girlfriend who, , was from Vineland, so went back a few

[00:19:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** times,

[00:19:59] **Ken Wheeler:** [00:20:00] Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean back then,
right? Like you would go get like a room at the trop for like 45. You know, I'd
work whatever bullshit job I had at the time and go to the

[00:20:08] **Ken Wheeler:** trop and like inside, like the main like thing area,
it looks like you're outside, like they put like fucking fake blue sky above
you. And it's like a two story thing and like you go into clubs and go and
fucking gamble and shit. But like you, you just walk around in there and that
was when, you know, you were allowed to smoke everywhere. Yeah.

[00:20:24] **Ken Wheeler:** So I'd be walking through there, smoking a blunt,
and they'd be like, without a fucking, ah, you see your boys, you're like, ah.

[00:20:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. it's quite, it's quite a leap from
Boardwalk Empire. I don't know if you ever watched that, but

[00:20:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** that

[00:20:34] **Ken Wheeler:** I did, yeah, it's not the same. It's actually funny,
the place Asbury that I was talking about used to be like that.

[00:20:39] **Ken Wheeler:** The place Asbury, it was like the, one of the
original shore resorts, where they had like casinos and all this shit, and

[00:20:46] **Ken Wheeler:** it was all crazy. , and then it went to shit in like
the 60s riots, and then, I lived there briefly, and it was crazy.

[00:20:52] **Ken Wheeler:** The shit was like Bananas. You know, what the fuck
is going on? It was

[00:20:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Like New Jersey bananas or regular sized
bananas?

[00:20:59] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, like New [00:21:00] Jersey bananas

[00:21:00] **Chris Power:** the small bananas

[00:21:01] **Chris Power:** you got earlier

[00:21:03] **Ken Wheeler:** Uh, like,

[00:21:04] **Ken Wheeler:** they started, like, basically a bunch of artists
move in.

[00:21:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh,

[00:21:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah.

[00:21:08] **Ken Wheeler:** And start, like, all these, like, trendy restaurants
and coffee places and

[00:21:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** And they make it

[00:21:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** good,

[00:21:13] **Ken Wheeler:** Then the investors came in and now it's like luxury
condos and

[00:21:17] **Ken Wheeler:** shit and all this fucking So now it's it's it's
really really hopping

[00:21:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** It is interesting how, at least this is how it
used to be, like, when I was younger living in the Midwest or whatever in
downtown, I lived downtown Cincinnati for a little bit, and like, any unsafe
areas would always get changed when, , you would see artists move in and, uh,
The gay community, move in. And that's like the first steps.

[00:21:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then like, the gay community is like
revamping homes and making them super cool and whatever else and then boom, ,
everybody else comes in and then

[00:21:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** phew.

[00:21:50] **Ken Wheeler:** year old victorians immaculately restored

[00:21:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, yeah. Just like fucking crushing it. And
you're like, well, you know, that's what I want.

[00:21:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh, Charles says, un question. [00:22:00] Où
sont les toilettes?

[00:22:02] **Ken Wheeler:** who's on the toilet

[00:22:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I guess. Who's on the toilets?

[00:22:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** I, I think so.

[00:22:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I

[00:22:07] **Ken Wheeler:** dude if I had

[00:22:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** like that. I just wanted

[00:22:09] **Ken Wheeler:** would be unbelievable Oh

[00:22:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** on here. Kevin's getting crazy. Kamala has four
husbands. I don't know.

[00:22:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** Break,

[00:22:17] **Chris Power:** I heard that

[00:22:19] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I

[00:22:20] **Robbie Wagner:** don't I don't know what's

[00:22:21] **Robbie Wagner:** happening in that comment or what that was in
reference

[00:22:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** don't know.

[00:22:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:22:26] **Chris Power:** this is twitch chat,

[00:22:28] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't know though. It all is in the chat on the
side of riverside

[00:22:33] **Robbie Wagner:** so

[00:22:33] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't know where it's coming from I

[00:22:34] **Robbie Wagner:** think it

[00:22:36] **Robbie Wagner:** it says these are YouTube

[00:22:37] **Robbie Wagner:** they're all YouTube

[00:22:38] **Chris Power:** I was gonna say this sounds like YouTube?

[00:22:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm in the

[00:22:40] **Ken Wheeler:** Oh, yeah, I am

[00:22:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** Live stream chat. Yeah, you should be able to
see things. You can message people if you want there. Do whatever. We're
amateurs when it comes to this whole, like, chat and

[00:22:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** streaming and all this stuff.

[00:22:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. So, hey, what do you think, chat? You
know, all of that stuff. Like, I'll watch Prime. [00:23:00] Uh, that's where Ken
keeps his. I don't know, it's his hard tuck. Stretch and a tuck.

[00:23:05] **Chris Power:** hell yeah, it's a stretch

[00:23:07] **Ken Wheeler:** You know, like that little fucking thing on the side
of the vacuum that you

[00:23:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** You know, too many details. Too many details

[00:23:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** makes it

[00:23:15] **Chris Power:** docked right now.

[00:23:16] **Chris Power:** he's docked right now with the vacuum.

[00:23:19] **Ken Wheeler:** Docton.

[00:23:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:23:20] **Chris Power:** docked. He's just, yeah.

[00:23:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** The Flowbee, instead of cutting his hair, he
likes to dip a little something else in it. , you know, it's just the only one
that has the right amount of suction. , whoa,

[00:23:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** went

[00:23:29] **Chris Power:** chat? Is this like a combined chat of Twitch and
YouTube?

[00:23:33] **Robbie Wagner:** I guess I don't know if anyone is on Twitch. It
doesn't look like they are

[00:23:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, I'm not sure. But I was saying, is when I
turn on, like, Prime's, , stream, and there's a couple others I try to watch
here and there, but I don't, I just can't keep up. Like, if I'm, if they're
reading an article or something, I can listen to that, but if I'm, like, trying
to watch and all this is going on, I'm just like, I don't know.

[00:23:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** Overload, I can't keep up. I don't know how you
actually do that.

[00:23:57] **Chris Power:** I think just occasionally you see something
[00:24:00] fly by and you read that one and then like you just kind of lose it
eventually, but yeah.

[00:24:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I'm just gonna start showing up and just
saying butt penis. See how

[00:24:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** long I'm allowed to

[00:24:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** stay

[00:24:10] **Ken Wheeler:** I do that on blue sky. I'll just show up. I don't
know

[00:24:12] **Ken Wheeler:** where I'll be like penis and

[00:24:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** tell us about Blue Sky. I just, I don't have a
problem with it, I just have enough fatigue about social media in general.

[00:24:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** And so like, yeah, I'm just like, I don't know,
this one is already a lot,

[00:24:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** so.

[00:24:26] **Ken Wheeler:** me, it's like, uh, I'll tell you what. I got on
there like really, really early.

[00:24:31] **Ken Wheeler:** And then stopped using it and then came back just to
see how it was when everybody went over.

[00:24:37] **Ken Wheeler:** And it is actually refreshing, how much tech content
is in the feed.

[00:24:42] **Ken Wheeler:** Versus fucking yap from AI dorks

[00:24:47] **Ken Wheeler:** However, right it also kind of like skews like hate
Ken Wheeler, so

[00:24:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** They hate

[00:24:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ken

[00:24:53] **Ken Wheeler:** go go there

[00:24:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:24:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's like, you better watch your [00:25:00] P's
and Q's, buddy, if you're gonna show up there.

[00:25:02] **Ken Wheeler:** right

[00:25:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, there's no butt penis over there. Yeah,

[00:25:10] **Ken Wheeler:** me on Twitter, but on there it's only like two or
three So I could totally post hog

[00:25:39] **Robbie Wagner:** post it, post it in the chat.

[00:25:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** here's, here's how I

[00:25:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** perceive the Wheeler vs. AI Bros arc. Is, it's
the slick carousel guy versus dudes who, have their life savings initially in
blockchain are trying to pivot to any life raft they can find.

[00:25:58] **Ken Wheeler:** I don't think the crypto guys [00:26:00] are doing
too bad right now to be honest with

[00:26:01] **Ken Wheeler:** you.

[00:26:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, yeah,

[00:26:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** they've seen a swing. You might see a jump back,

[00:26:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:26:05] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, I mean, they're, they're, they're kinda, you
know,

[00:26:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, anybody who stayed in the majors,

[00:26:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** but

[00:26:09] **Ken Wheeler:** If I was allowed to, I'd fucking short Bitcoin right
now.

[00:26:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, right. Oh, you're not allowed to? So give
me your money and

[00:26:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** nobody will

[00:26:15] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, no, that's not allowed either. But,

[00:26:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Are they gonna, there's a paper

[00:26:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** trail

[00:26:19] **Ken Wheeler:** That's also not investment

[00:26:20] **Robbie Wagner:** of crypto? That

[00:26:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh,

[00:26:22] **Robbie Wagner:** allowed?

[00:26:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** So you heard it here, folks.

[00:26:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** Mortgage, just highly leverage all of your
family's assets and short Bitcoin.

[00:26:30] **Ken Wheeler:** Mm hmm.

[00:26:30] **Chris Power:** yeah

[00:26:31] **Robbie Wagner:** I mean, I would have never thought I would have
gotten to 100, 000, like, It's insane.

[00:26:36] **Robbie Wagner:** I remember

[00:26:37] **Robbie Wagner:** getting rid of

[00:26:38] **Robbie Wagner:** tons of them at like 20 and being like, Oh, these
things are worthless. Like how to sell them. This is a good amount. Ah,

[00:26:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** just to break even at one point, and I did the
thing with the Doge. Also, I think I made a little money out of

[00:26:55] **Ken Wheeler:** I take profit every single cycle.

[00:26:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah,

[00:26:57] **Ken Wheeler:** But, I mean, back in the day, dude, we used to use
that shit to, [00:27:00] like, buy e pills off the internet. And,

[00:27:01] **Ken Wheeler:** like, fucking, we had, like, hundreds of them.

[00:27:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** right,

[00:27:03] **Ken Wheeler:** fucking, dude, I can't even tell you how hard I
looked for, like, old hard drives at my mom's house.

[00:27:08] **Chris Power:** Cuz

[00:27:09] **Ken Wheeler:** where's all that shit that was in my room?

[00:27:10] **Ken Wheeler:** I'm

[00:27:11] **Ken Wheeler:** like, No!

[00:27:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** Let's see. Someone else is rich.

[00:27:16] **Chris Power:** damn.

[00:27:17] **Ken Wheeler:** Searching. Dude, so, if I ever found that, oh, man.
Unprecedented wealth. I wonder how much Bitcoin is actually unaccounted for. Has

[00:27:23] **Ken Wheeler:** to

[00:27:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh,

[00:27:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm

[00:27:24] **Chris Power:** Oh so much so much

[00:27:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** I would guess quite a bit, which probably
doesn't hurt its values. Like it's never going to get moved. That just increases
rarity.

[00:27:33] **Chris Power:** Yeah, it's the blockchain baby.

[00:27:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hmm.

[00:27:37] **Chris Power:** The linked list, the big linked list,

[00:27:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:27:40] **Chris Power:** the big link.

[00:27:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** Block link links forever in perpetuity.

[00:27:44] **Chris Power:** I never got into, , crypto currency at all. It's
just, it was never really a big thing for me. I feel like maybe a couple
thousand bucks at it, like a couple years ago, took that money out as soon as I
broke even. And I was like, yeah, I'm all done with it. I just don't have the
time to really think about it and like, be good [00:28:00] at like knowing what
to do, you

[00:28:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** Agree. I kind of was in the same boat where I
was like, I don't have the time to really like put my head in

[00:28:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** this.

[00:28:07] **Ken Wheeler:** I got in there. It was dumb.

[00:28:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:28:10] **Robbie Wagner:** do you'll be really rich. Like

[00:28:14] **Robbie Wagner:** I've lost all of my money on everything I've ever
done. So just follow me for the opposite of what you want to do. Just short
anything I'm doing and uh, you're good.

[00:28:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:28:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah. You wouldn't, you can't tell. Yeah,
exactly. Well, that's the George Costanza thing. all of his instincts of
anything he's ever done have been wrong, so the opposite must be right. You
remember that Seinfeld? And then he goes up to the woman and he decides, rather
than the lies he normally does, he's like, Hi, I'm George, I'm this old, and I'm
balding, and live with my parents.

[00:28:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** And she's like, Well, hello.

[00:28:48] **Chris Power:** Yeah.

[00:28:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. So. Yeah, that's a good one. But I was
gonna say, so, Robbie, you can't tell, cause the lighting is good and stuff, but
that is actually a trailer, like [00:29:00] a double wide trailer, that he's in
right now. Yeah. And, um, yeah, yeah. He drives a 1990 Bronco.

[00:29:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's not white

[00:29:09] **Ken Wheeler:** Do you know what I would give for a fucking trailer
in a 1990 Bronco?

[00:29:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh, I don't know, a week's salary, maybe? I
mean, it would, it doesn't sound too hard,

[00:29:19] **Ken Wheeler:** I'm just not allowed to do that sort of thing.

[00:29:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay, well

[00:29:21] **Ken Wheeler:** But if I were,

[00:29:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, so.

[00:29:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't think

[00:29:26] **Ken Wheeler:** the two and just get like a fucking Airstream or

[00:29:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** just pull it around with the

[00:29:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Bronco.

[00:29:29] **Ken Wheeler:** camper vans and just set it up

[00:29:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. In

[00:29:33] **Ken Wheeler:** a kegerator into it,

[00:29:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** Mm hmm, yeah.

[00:29:36] **Ken Wheeler:** all this fucking shit.

[00:29:38] **Chris Power:** Hell yeah.

[00:29:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** But then just be too much of like a giant slug
to ever go use the guns or drive it anywhere.

[00:29:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** You're just like eating Funyuns and you're like,
The internet is stupid! I know. this is what, uh, this is the pit of disparity
we may all

[00:29:54] **Robbie Wagner:** speaking of stupid Internet, want to ask a thing
and I have no idea the [00:30:00] context. What is the react t shirt incident?

[00:30:02] **Chris Power:** Oh!

[00:30:03] **Chris Power:** I wanted to know too!

[00:30:04] **Chris Power:** I wanted to know?

[00:30:05] **Chris Power:** that too.

[00:30:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Mm mm,

[00:30:06] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, I thought you knew because you were like, I
don't know and I thought that was like a joke

[00:30:10] **Robbie Wagner:** that you

[00:30:11] **Robbie Wagner:** did know

[00:30:11] **Ken Wheeler:** Wait, do you guys, do you not know? I know, I'll
tell you all about

[00:30:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't

[00:30:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** know.

[00:30:15] **Chris Power:** yeah I want to

[00:30:15] **Chris Power:** hear it.

[00:30:16] **Ken Wheeler:** my buddy goes and creates this shirt you ever seen
one of those shirts where it's like, it's like Washington and Lincoln and
fucking do do do do, you know, like, it's like five names that pertain to a

[00:30:27] **Ken Wheeler:** thing

[00:30:28] **Ken Wheeler:** Right. So they did that with React and people got
upset that it was all fellers and that was the React t-shirt incident.

[00:30:35] **Chris Power:** Oh, cause it was all dudes?

[00:30:37] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah.

[00:30:37] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay. It doesn't sound that bad. I was hoping for
more controversy.

[00:30:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:30:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, you were shooting for

[00:30:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** something

[00:30:43] **Ken Wheeler:** I assure you it was heated at the time.

[00:30:45] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:30:47] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I tried to Google it, and all I found is
like 10 different sites are selling our React Was A Mistake t shirts

[00:30:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh yeah, they

[00:30:56] **Robbie Wagner:** us.

[00:30:57] **Ken Wheeler:** Well, it was. It was particularly contentious 'cause
I [00:31:00] was on the fucking shirt

[00:31:01] **Robbie Wagner:** ha ha

[00:31:01] **Robbie Wagner:** ha

[00:31:02] **Robbie Wagner:** ha

[00:31:02] **Robbie Wagner:** ha

[00:31:02] **Robbie Wagner:** ha ha What the fuck?

[00:31:06] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah

[00:31:08] **Chris Power:** the only thing I uh, when I, when I looked it up,
the only thing I found was the uh, the circle game incident. At a conference,
which was, uh, I thought very funny, but also kind of sad that people got that
upset about that.

[00:31:20] **Chris Power:** Such a classic game.

[00:31:22] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah. And it was the game in context too. So

[00:31:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, what was the circle game

[00:31:27] **Ken Wheeler:** you don't remember that, that, that I'm not fucked.
Oh, that's fucking bait doing that shit.

[00:31:33] **Chris Power:** Well, guys, if you want to

[00:31:34] **Chris Power:** know

[00:31:34] **Chris Power:** the circle game, guys, if you want to know the
circle game, just look down here. Well so now

[00:31:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

[00:31:43] **Robbie Wagner:** I know. Yeah Yeah

[00:31:54] **Ken Wheeler:** I tell you the funniest thing you've ever heard in
your entire life?

[00:31:57] **Ken Wheeler:** So that was actually a backup joke, was, it was
React [00:32:00] Rally And it was in Salt Lake City. And I was, I was going to
come out in a white shirt and ask them if they had a minute to talk about our
Lord and Savior React.

[00:32:08] **Ken Wheeler:** So, so, so I go and, and ask the dudes running the
conference. I'm like, I'm like, Hey, I have like an idea for like a joke opener,
but you know,

[00:32:18] **Ken Wheeler:** Perhaps a little heat on it, right? they're like, Do
not do that. Under no circumstances should you ever do that. I'm like, I'm like,
okay, yeah, I won't.

[00:32:28] **Ken Wheeler:** that's what I picked.

[00:32:30] **Ken Wheeler:** I was like, oh, I'll just fuckin tell everybody in
the audience I'll get to punch him now.

[00:32:33] **Chris Power:** That's a

[00:32:33] **Chris Power:** genius idea. Just go on as a missionary.

[00:32:36] **Ken Wheeler:** That would've

[00:32:36] **Ken Wheeler:** been fuckin funny as fuck, but

[00:32:38] **Ken Wheeler:** no,

[00:32:38] **Ken Wheeler:** they

[00:32:38] **Chris Power:** That's so good.

[00:32:39] **Ken Wheeler:** No, but then, then I go do the other thing, and
fuckin that, that's the problem.

[00:32:43] **Chris Power:** Yeah, right.

[00:32:43] **Chris Power:** Yeah.

[00:32:44] **Ken Wheeler:** I did the Lord and Savior thing, like a couple
Mormon guys would've came up to me after and be like, What the, come on, cut
that shit out.

[00:32:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** Come on. We don't love that. Yeah. Or said
nothing. But that, I might do that. I mean, we are, we like to troll. I mean, we
showed up to React Miami with React was a [00:33:00] mistake t shirts. So
trolling is good. So, maybe I'm gonna go to

[00:33:03] **Ken Wheeler:** fucking choir if you go to a React conference saying
that shit.

[00:33:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, right? Yeah, they, everybody feels that,
but here it is, it's pervasive, it's the, you know, it's where we are.

[00:33:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** I, I might, I'm not gonna go fucking write
Angular.

[00:33:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, right, yeah, exactly, like,

[00:33:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** look at

[00:33:17] **Chris Power:** not gonna, Hey, we're not going to write Ember.
Okay,

[00:33:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:33:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** well, nobody will pay you to write Ember. I
would write Ember, nobody

[00:33:23] **Robbie Wagner:** places will

[00:33:24] **Robbie Wagner:** pay you

[00:33:25] **Robbie Wagner:** to write angular at least they won't pay you to
write ember

[00:33:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** SolidJS, I mean, that's like a side project
fucking,

[00:33:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** you

[00:33:32] **Robbie Wagner:** know, places it'll pay me to write ember because
if you

[00:33:34] **Ken Wheeler:** SolidJS is awesome, I wish I could fucking

[00:33:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, no, I would be down.

[00:33:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Like, that wasn't shade, that was just like,
it's very niche. You know what was also cool? Elixir is cool. There's like, two

[00:33:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** places, I thought it was cool. and,

[00:33:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah.

[00:33:48] **Robbie Wagner:** Nope. Cause that's Dockyard's thing. So we can't,
we can't

[00:33:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right, oh right, we can't like it. I don't know,
you, yeah, okay. Well, there you go.

[00:33:56] **Chris Power:** Yeah, fuck those guys.

[00:33:58] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:33:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** you heard it.

[00:34:12] **Ken Wheeler:** Brian just

[00:34:13] **Ken Wheeler:** catching.

[00:34:14] **Robbie Wagner:** I think he lives in a giant vault of gold is
probably where his address is.

[00:34:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:34:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. His

[00:34:20] **Chris Power:** I spoke at little Ember meetup once in Boston at
their headquarters. It was cool.

[00:34:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay,

[00:34:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** then. I don't think they have a

[00:34:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** physical

[00:34:28] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, fuck those guys.

[00:34:29] **Chris Power:** Fuck those guys.

[00:34:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't know.

[00:34:37] **Ken Wheeler:** that's, that's all

[00:34:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** house, but like, when they call you to the
mothership, where do you

[00:34:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** go? I don't know.

[00:34:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** You can't say a city. You can't say a

[00:34:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** city.

[00:34:45] **Ken Wheeler:** From time to time, I will find myself in major U. S.
cities

[00:34:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** for the FBI. He's a fucking

[00:34:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** snitch. I think that's what we just figured out.

[00:34:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** He's

[00:34:54] **Chris Power:** he went, he went to Miami, he went to a co working
space.

[00:34:57] **Chris Power:** Just for a little bit.

[00:34:58] **Chris Power:** Maybe he has co working [00:35:00] spaces that he
likes to go to elsewhere.

[00:35:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, maybe.

[00:35:03] **Ken Wheeler:** out and about.

[00:35:41] **Robbie Wagner:** did

[00:35:41] **Robbie Wagner:** appreciate the text

[00:36:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Actually, I think you're overachieving. I think
going through twins, the infant stage, didn't dissuade [00:37:00] you from doing
that again, taking a shot at that,

[00:37:03] **Chris Power:** Yeah, I know. That was, Yeah, I always take shots.
I'm always taking my shots.

his daughter and son in law during the wedding to like, drive with the just
married cans

favor? Can you drive it over here?

[00:40:44] **Ken Wheeler:** And I was like, ah, I'll tell you what, I suppose.

[00:41:05] **Chris Power:** God, you have to. It's

[00:41:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** three, you gotta get a GT three Rs YOC edition,
and then if you special order it, you're basically gonna never lose any money.
It's not a depreciating asset, which is pretty nice too.

[00:41:18] **Chris Power:** That's pretty cool.

[00:41:19] **Robbie Wagner:** Unlike all cars i've ever bought,

[00:41:22] **Chris Power:** Robbie, are you a car guy?

[00:41:23] **Robbie Wagner:** no, I mean i've dabbled

[00:41:25] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:41:26] **Robbie Wagner:** had a uh, I had a pretty nice bronco resto mod
that I

[00:41:30] **Robbie Wagner:** had to sell because I don't have any money
anymore.

[00:41:33] **Ken Wheeler:** are fire

[00:41:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, and that was a sick bronco, too. That was
a really cool one.

[00:41:38] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, but yeah, I mean i'm kind of like whatever

[00:41:42] **Robbie Wagner:** pre ordered Several electric suvs whenever
somebody will actually make one

[00:41:48] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm just gonna get some of those and never have to
get gas again.

[00:41:50] **Robbie Wagner:** It

[00:41:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** That new Scout does look cool. So International
Scout uh, started accept Harvester,

[00:41:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Scout. Yes. So they started accepting pre
[00:42:00] orders for like two years from now, something like that. And their
SUV is really nice. It's like on the Rivian platform, but has more like retro y
looking things.

[00:42:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Well, it's just called Scout now, because
International Harvester sold it to VW.

[00:42:14] **Robbie Wagner:** So, VW's making them, basically. Or not,

[00:42:17] **Ken Wheeler:** you guys don't see any risk in buying some rando
fucking brand.

[00:42:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, they're a VW backed brand. And isn't Rivian
a Rando brand?

[00:42:25] **Ken Wheeler:** I didn't buy a fucking

[00:42:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** a Rando brand? Oh, well they're pretty nice. I
bought one and sold it for money.

[00:42:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** So it was cool. Yeah, yeah, we pre I pre
ordered, and then my wife didn't want

[00:42:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** it,

[00:42:34] **Ken Wheeler:** I want a Toyota Hilux

[00:42:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:42:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** don't

[00:42:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** even

[00:42:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** Toyota.

[00:42:39] **Chris Power:** A bed mounted machine gun.

[00:42:45] **Chris Power:** Hell yeah.

[00:42:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** no, no.

[00:42:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** no.

[00:42:50] **Chris Power:** yeah, dude. Fuck

[00:42:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** They're like 10, 000 pounds. Those giant hump So
in Arizona, there's like crazy cars everywhere. I mean, there's probably
[00:43:00] like a hundred Cybertrucks in my neighborhood.

[00:43:03] **Ken Wheeler:** I see Cybertrucks a lot.

[00:43:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** wrapped. That's like weird.

[00:43:07] **Ken Wheeler:** I wanna get a Cybertruck and wrap it in snow camo.

[00:43:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** McLarens in my neighborhood too,

[00:43:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** though.

[00:43:13] **Ken Wheeler:** Is any of them snow camo?

[00:43:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh uh.

[00:43:16] **Chris Power:** There you

[00:43:17] **Ken Wheeler:** It should be.

[00:43:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** do you feel like that's ineffective in the
desert?

[00:43:21] **Ken Wheeler:** No, I think it's a

[00:43:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** Snow camo? You're always gonna be

[00:43:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** seen.

[00:43:25] **Chris Power:** one will expect it. No one

[00:43:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:43:27] **Ken Wheeler:** You drive through the desert, Cybertruck.

[00:43:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** And bright white. You gotta get desert camo.

[00:43:30] **Ken Wheeler:** Rollin up,

[00:43:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** might be cool. I

[00:43:32] **Ken Wheeler:** down, dick out, dude.

[00:43:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** uh.

[00:43:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Alright, let's figure out how to go fund me a
Lambo that I can snow camo.

[00:43:40] **Chris Power:** I'm

[00:43:40] **Chris Power:** in, I'm in Robbie's

[00:43:41] **Chris Power:** boat. I had actually had a Bronco, a

[00:43:43] **Chris Power:** new one that I liked, but I got rid of it because it
was too expensive.

[00:43:47] **Chris Power:** here's the thing, controversial take. They're not
that good. They're not very good cars.

[00:43:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ooh. A Ford

[00:43:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** isn't

[00:43:53] **Ken Wheeler:** Well, yeah, It's a Ford.

[00:43:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, it's not about being good. It's about being
fun.

[00:43:58] **Chris Power:** So yes, I agree. It's [00:44:00] fun. It's a very
fun car, but like just driving it every day. I was like, it's just Such a rough
ride

[00:44:06] **Chris Power:** for how much money it costs. And I was

[00:44:07] **Chris Power:** like, I get it. It's an

[00:44:09] **Ken Wheeler:** What are you drivin now?

[00:44:10] **Chris Power:** well, I drive a very fancy car. It's a, um, 2024.
Very

[00:44:15] **Chris Power:** nice.

[00:44:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ford Focus. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! But it's

[00:44:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** new!

[00:44:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ha ha ha

[00:44:24] **Chris Power:** Volkswagen

[00:44:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** ha!

[00:44:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** that the big one?

[00:44:27] **Chris Power:** No, it's a small. It's the

[00:44:28] **Chris Power:** opposite. Think

[00:44:28] **Chris Power:** opposite

[00:44:29] **Chris Power:** of big and small, but, um,

[00:44:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's the New Jersey sized

[00:44:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** one.

[00:44:32] **Chris Power:** I

[00:44:32] **Chris Power:** yeah, I might, I might drive 7, 000 miles a year at
most.

[00:44:36] **Chris Power:** So like, you know,

[00:44:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** Same.

[00:44:38] **Chris Power:** didn't need much and I just wanted to reduce the
cost

[00:44:41] **Chris Power:** of, you know, baby threes on the way. Can I reduce
the cost a little

[00:44:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** No, I feel you. Yeah, yeah.

[00:44:46] **Chris Power:** So the Volkswagen's house is easy.

[00:44:48] **Chris Power:** Something, you know, whatever.

[00:44:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. That's what

[00:44:49] **Ken Wheeler:** So I, uh, I have two. And, for her, right, she
wanted a three row.

[00:44:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, yes. Yeah.

[00:44:57] **Ken Wheeler:** child folk. Right? So we got a Grand [00:45:00]
Cherokee L. Which is a three row Grand Cherokee. And it's a big fucking,

[00:45:04] **Ken Wheeler:** you know, I'm sitting here trying to pull into
parking spots and I'm like, what the fuck, dude, this thing is huge. But it's
okay because I, I like select cars almost exclusively on the user interface of
their music system.

[00:45:15] **Chris Power:** Mmm.

[00:45:16] **Ken Wheeler:** And Chrysler has a very good one. I used to be a
Jeep guy. Chrysler's really good. I hate Fords. Chevy's is okay. there's others
that I like or don't like, but Oh, the new Kia shit's pretty sick. But Chrysler,
across everything, Dodge, all that shit, the interface is pretty fucking tight.

[00:45:31] **Ken Wheeler:** My other car is a Land Rover Defender, and the
difference in ride between that and the Grand Cherokee is unbelievable.
Similarly sized vehicles, but like fucking, like if you're actually driving, you
know, you had the red wine or two, you're going to 7 Eleven,

[00:45:47] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. We, uh, we rented a defender to take down to
all things

[00:45:51] **Robbie Wagner:** open and it was actually, yeah, like going 90 on
the freeway is like not bumpy, which I was surprised [00:46:00] by.

[00:46:00] **Chris Power:** And the Defender?

[00:46:01] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah.

[00:46:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, no, it was, it was decent. Who went 90, me
or you?

[00:46:05] **Robbie Wagner:** mostly you. I touched it a couple of times, but I
was like, that's what, like, when I hit that, I was like, I feel like I'm not
going that fast. Like, this is really

[00:46:15] **Chris Power:** That's no, it was, it was a nice car. Like, in
general. Yeah, I mean, unsurprising that a Land Rover has, like, better creature
comforts than just, like,

[00:46:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** ride.

[00:46:25] **Ken Wheeler:** reasonably spartan compared to a Range Rover.

[00:46:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, for sure.

[00:46:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:46:30] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah, the

[00:46:30] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:46:30] **Robbie Wagner:** the extra middle seat in the front. That's pretty
dope.

[00:46:34] **Ken Wheeler:** yeah, it's like a Jeep, kind of,

[00:46:35] **Ken Wheeler:** right?

[00:46:36] **Ken Wheeler:** It's like a luxury Jeep

[00:46:40] **Ken Wheeler:** of sorts, but like the Range Rover itself had way
more accoutrements.

[00:46:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, the Range Rover is more of like, you know,
the Bentley of SUVs in a way, or had been like sort

[00:46:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** of

[00:46:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** like

[00:46:50] **Robbie Wagner:** I think Bentley is the Bentley of SUVs.

[00:46:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well now, now that they all make everything, the
stupid Lamborghini one, also all over my neighborhood, which is just an,
[00:47:00] a Q8 with a Lambo engine in it, they're so annoying.

[00:47:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** And the Ferrari one's coming out soon, which I'm
sure a bunch of Scottsdale moms are gonna buy.

[00:47:09] **Ken Wheeler:** Have you seen these vehicles where they're like
bulletproof SUVs?

[00:47:13] **Chris Power:** Yes.

[00:47:15] **Ken Wheeler:** I want one of those so

[00:47:16] **Chris Power:** Those look so sick.

[00:47:17] **Ken Wheeler:** They're so fucking they're like 200 000 so i'm
probably not gonna get it ever

[00:47:21] **Chris Power:** I forget the name of them. I've seen it though.

[00:47:23] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah.

[00:47:23] **Ken Wheeler:** it's a sick of shit dude

[00:47:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** Then you better confirm what 9 11 you want,
because you're in that, you're in that land.

[00:47:30] **Ken Wheeler:** Yeah a used one

[00:47:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, well, like

[00:47:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:47:34] **Ken Wheeler:** could get a new one, but i'm gonna get a lower trim
if I got a new

[00:47:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, you get like a

[00:47:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** five to

[00:47:39] **Ken Wheeler:** In this

[00:47:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** one, and it's Yeah, well, that's the thing is
the GT3 is really scaled back in terms of creature comfort. So it's not like I
care about car play and a bunch of like things like that that are changing all
the time. So otherwise, the technology is just all

[00:47:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** mostly in the

[00:47:56] **Ken Wheeler:** little fucker like that dude, like I would just

[00:47:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, who cares? like [00:48:00] manual and i'd
be fucking just sitting there like

[00:48:02] **Ken Wheeler:** It would be an activity in and of itself

[00:48:03] **Ken Wheeler:** Whereas like my current car right now is like point
a to point b

[00:48:07] **Ken Wheeler:** Listen to future and fucking drink a coffee kind

[00:48:10] **Ken Wheeler:** of

[00:48:10] **Ken Wheeler:** thing

[00:48:11] **Ken Wheeler:** What is g next

[00:48:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** The new Kendrick Lamar album.

[00:48:15] **Chris Power:** Ooh, I heard

[00:48:17] **Ken Wheeler:** god damn it, you know what

[00:48:18] **Chris Power:** I heard

[00:48:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** I've been listening

[00:48:20] **Ken Wheeler:** I don't fucking

[00:48:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** the last couple days. Oh, you're a Drake fan.

[00:48:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** You fucking Canadian,

[00:48:25] **Ken Wheeler:** I am a Drake fan. I'm a fan of the other rap too.
But, you know, the thing with Kendrick, uh, The production on the album is very
good. I just don't rock to that shit. I mean? I know motherfuckers are like, Oh,
Kendrick's good. I listen to this. Kendrick's good. Kendrick got a Pulitzer.
He's fucking, you know.

[00:48:41] **Ken Wheeler:** You know, you gotta listen to it, man. Really listen
to it. It's good. I'm not trying to listen to it. music is escapism for me. I
listen to

[00:48:46] **Ken Wheeler:** fucking Lil Pump.

[00:48:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, like, you're not trying to get, you're not
trying to get

[00:48:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** like, Oh, let me, let me, let me, absorb it over
time. I, I mean, here you go, here's my hot

[00:48:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** take.

[00:48:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:48:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** think the,

[00:48:57] **Ken Wheeler:** you something about me Thick white bitch sitting in
the [00:49:00] front seat.

[00:49:01] **Ken Wheeler:** Scoot! What? Like

[00:49:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think the new Eminem is better than the new, ,
Kendrick Lamar.

[00:49:10] **Ken Wheeler:** That is a hot

[00:49:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. The new

[00:49:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Eminem is good.

[00:49:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think it's very good.

[00:49:14] **Robbie Wagner:** is good,

[00:49:14] **Robbie Wagner:** but,

[00:49:15] **Robbie Wagner:** I like the like story, like

[00:49:17] **Robbie Wagner:** overarching

[00:49:17] **Robbie Wagner:** story

[00:49:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** it has a whole

[00:49:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** thing, like, you can just kind of listen
through. The Kendrick Lamar, I'm like, I don't know, this one's not for me, oh,
this one's better,

[00:49:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** and

[00:49:27] **Robbie Wagner:** It's like when you have the fucking like movies
that win oscars and shit and they're like the worst fucking movie you've ever
seen

[00:49:33] **Robbie Wagner:** It's like because they're artsy. It's not because
it's actually

[00:49:36] **Robbie Wagner:** good. It's

[00:49:37] **Robbie Wagner:** like

[00:49:38] **Ken Wheeler:** one was admittedly less artsy. Like, he's actually
saying

[00:49:40] **Ken Wheeler:** a

[00:49:40] **Ken Wheeler:** little bit of shit on this one. And the beats were
very good.

[00:49:43] **Ken Wheeler:** You know, and it's a weird kind of West Coast, like,
fucking proto hyphy thing going

[00:49:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** but it also has like a very like kind of like
chill vibe to some of it. There's a lot of piano. There's a lot of like, yeah.

[00:49:53] **Ken Wheeler:** It's good. It's not for me.

[00:49:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** There you

[00:49:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** go.

[00:49:58] **Ken Wheeler:** If you want to know like what I listen to,
[00:50:00] like what I love is Lil

[00:50:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** Love. Lil

[00:50:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** Wayne?

[00:50:04] **Ken Wheeler:** So much like that's my shit.

[00:50:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Huh.

[00:50:07] **Ken Wheeler:** Shit like that like those beats and you know him
saying shit like that's the kind of rap that I like

[00:50:13] **Ken Wheeler:** lowbrow highbrow.

[00:50:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** So more like Dirty South kind

[00:50:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** of.

[00:50:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** ha.

[00:50:23] **Chris Power:** I used to love, I loved. Rap when I was like
probably too young to really like it. You know what I mean? Like I love like Wu
Tang Clan

[00:50:31] **Chris Power:** and like Jay Z.
