[00:00:00]

**Mark:** welcome everyone to episode 54 of the Puff podcast. [00:01:00] Good evening, gentlemen. I'm one of three of your hosts for tonight at Puff Provisions, Mark. Well, according to my screen, you're first on the bottom. How you doing, buddy? Good evening.

**Mike:** I'm good. No, I'm good. I'm good. No complaints. It's about to be a holiday tomorrow. We got it off.

**Mark:** of this recording,

**Mike:** Off in the name of freedom.

**Mark:** birthday

**Mark:** We can talk

**Mike:** yes. 1776.

**Mark:** We'll let a little bit later. Yeah.

**Mike:** I'm good though. I'm good. I'm good.

**Mark:** All right.

**Mike:** No complaints.

**Mark:** Hey, it's kind of suited even though I'm probably gonna this part out But there's a happy birthday sign behind at puff provisions Darrell. Are you doing a night? Good evening, sir.

**Darrell:** How's it going? Happy birthday!

**Mark:** America that

**Darrell:** Happy

**Mark:** that was a happy birthday

**Darrell:** birthday, America.

**Mark:** that was a happy birthday sign for one of your kids recently I'm sure had a lot of fun handling that were you sober or were you a little bit? a lit if you will

**Mark:** [00:02:00] Party.

**Mark:** Don't mind. It's okay.

**Darrell:** was, I was, I was starting. I was already starting.

**Mark:** ease

**Darrell:** Did you smoke? Did you smoke before the birthday? Like near the end, when we were done with everything.

**Mark:** it's basically

**Mike:** I always smoked afterwards. No complaints.

**Mark:** I totally get it. I get

**Darrell:** I, I, I do much. I just nodded my head and smiled and the missus did, the missus did the rest.

**Mark:** hope you don't nod and smile tonight because we've got a good one tonight's topic is loosely inspired from last night's Last, yeah, our last episode actually, where I described the perfect food and I wanted to find something else that was, air quotes, perfect. So tonight, we're gonna talk about AI. We're gonna talk about how hot it's been getting, how it's not going away. no, we're not gonna do that because it's already happening around us. gonna have some fun with it. Tonight, we're gonna do weird science AI, loosely inspired by An 80s flick, and then it was rebooted, right? As a USA [00:03:00] flick in the 90s.

**Mark:** Do you remember the I remember the 90s one on USA Network more than I remember the movie. From the 80s. I don't know about you.

**Mike:** Weird science.

**Mark:** yeah. It was a TV show

**Mike:** Oh, no, I I I it was a tv show. I remember it was a tv show, but I didn't I didn't really I don't think I watched it. I may have watched a couple of full episodes, but I I I I associated with the movie for sure.

**Mark:** eighties then. All right, so then

**Mike:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Mark:** coming from in terms of where he associates tonight's conversation. 'cause I lean more towards the nineties TV show that I watched. But at any rate, we're gonna get to that in a second because I'm hoping, are you guys a little bit lit tonight? Holiday weekend. Get easing into the night.

**Mike:** So, yeah,

**Mark:** Go for it.

**Mike:** I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty lit. I actually, when I saw the topic

**Mark:** Weird science.

**Mike:** science ai. For some reason I thought weird l like I just [00:04:00] totally omitted science.

**Mark:** see it. I

**Mike:** I flipped them weird L 'cause ai A and then the lowercase L

**Darrell:** Mm

**Mike:** lowercase L. Yeah.

**Mark:** Aw, man.

**Mike:** I was like, what the hell are we gonna talk about weird L for?

**Mark:** English language. Ah.

**Mike:** I'm, I'm,

**Mark:** Good.

**Mike:** I'm lit.

**Mark:** good. Because that's where I need you to be. I don't need you to be 0. I need you to be at 1 right now for this one. Because this, this is gonna get a little bit too, a little too ridiculous, I think. What about you, D? Are you there?

**Darrell:** hmm. Do you just need us at 1?

**Mark:** you at 1.

**Darrell:** I'm

**Mark:** to 1. Alright.

**Darrell:** at 6. Is that bad?

**Mark:** edible? By way of a vape? What'd you do? What was

**Mark:** Twist?

**Darrell:** I smoked. Yeah, I smoked. Yeah.

**Mark:** schoolers out there preferring edibles and vape. But, yep, I puff too. gentlemen, here we go.

**Mark:** Let's get into some AI stuff. Because, honestly, this ain't going away. Right? You've noticed this thing around you [00:05:00] much every day. Who hasn't talked about it? Your co workers, maybe. Other friends that you have around you. We have here in this room behind, behind closed doors, ChatGPT and all that stuff, right? Have ChatGPT try

**Darrell:** Mm hmm.

**Mark:** this, right? And it's becoming more accessible and things like that. And I was thinking to myself, the power of it all is right there within a few keystrokes. knowing all of this, and in the dynamics of your life, As fathers. Full time desktop athletes, you know, husbands, and all that jazz that you are in between on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Which I think you guys have pretty busy lives. I'm sure your counterparts do too, but you lead busy lives as well. Am I wrong for saying that? Or am I right?

**Darrell:** No, no, no. We are busy. We're busy. On the go dads.

**Mark:** a lot, because it helps ease the stress, let's be honest. But, consider the dynamics of your life. Right now from left to right [00:06:00] let's build you the perfect AI I'm inspired to do it in a visual and visually a visual way just so all the listeners out there can kind of play pretend with us again to the alluding the weird science Mike Darrell, you to pretend we're sitting behind your computer and we're just going to type commands into the keyboard we're gonna take pictures from magazines and throw them on the scanner, and the computer's gonna automatically interpret what that means and what you want.

**Mark:** Stuff like that. That's how we're gonna do it tonight, alright? What'd you say?

**Darrell:** I need to clear my browser history before you guys get behind my computer.

**Mike:** Oh,

**Darrell:** didn't know you were going there. Just put it in incognito mode. Okay? We're good. You can keep whatever you want. We're not gonna look. there's, there's spillage into regular. From incognito to regular.

**Mark:** Spillage.

**Darrell:** some spillage.

**Mark:** heard that term between incognito and irregular mode. It's spillage. We're gonna out that. There's spillage between both. There [00:07:00] shouldn't be

**Darrell:** There's a spillage.

**Darrell:** have. That's a different story for a different day. It's because there's so many.

**Mark:** god, I

**Darrell:** Browser can't handle it. I

**Mark:** handle it browser can't handle it.

**Darrell:** Are you guys ready for this one? Because i've got three or four questions I made up in my head today and i'm gonna go with it. think before we start though, we gotta preface right? So, let's take a step back, so people understand our backgrounds, alright? When we approach this question, right? We grew up In the late 1900s, in the 1990s,

**Mark:** you could also

**Darrell:** all right,

**Mark:** too. We were

**Darrell:** the 1980s, like, well, we were, yeah, we were near the, we were the 10, the tail end of the 80s.

**Darrell:** And then we kind of owned the 90s all until early 2000s.

**Mark:** you could

**Darrell:** Right. but you got people have to understand, like when, when we, where we're coming from, because when we see it, we've never experienced this [00:08:00] before. Right. We're coming from like, if, you're, for example, you have to go to a house party and you have the street, but you have no clue how to get there. You had to use like the Thomas Brothers, right? You had to look up the street, flip to the page, and kind of do your own triangulation

**Mark:** you had to

**Darrell:** you would like Moana, you know?

**Mark:** through pages if you had the book version.

**Darrell:** You had to flip through pages, right? Nowadays it's, nowadays it's what? Oh, where is this address? Google it. And then it'll tell you,

**Mark:** tell you

**Darrell:** it'll tell you the surrounding area, it'll give you where to go.

**Darrell:** It'll even tell you how much that dude's house sold for. Right?

**Mark:** true. Didn't have that kind of

**Darrell:** Right?

**Mark:** day. set the stage even

**Darrell:** Right? So

**Mark:** set the stage even further. We grew up in a time where you couldn't skip an ad like you can on YouTube today.

**Darrell:** Yes.

**Mike:** oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**Mark:** You remember

**Darrell:** Yup. Mm hmm. Yup.

**Mark:** we were also [00:09:00] part of that era that had to hear

**Darrell:** hmm.

**Mark:** yourself dialing into the internet. You remember that?

**Darrell:** Exactly. Yeah. Exactly.

**Mark:** melody, that sound that it makes the

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** connect button. You remember?

**Darrell:** There's only a small of people that would understand what AOL is,

**Mark:** And how precious those 10,

**Darrell:** right?

**Mark:** free hours were.

**Darrell:** Yes. Yes.

**Mark:** honest.

**Darrell:** man. I check the mail every month. Every month. For my free, my free CD.

**Mark:** like

**Darrell:** My free floppy disk.

**Mark:** three of them. I know I

**Darrell:** Yeah, yeah,

**Mike:** waste that created? They were mailing everybody CDs.

**Mark:** Well, if

**Darrell:** plastic, the chemicals on

**Mike:** Eugh.

**Darrell:** Oh yeah, hell yeah. That was, that was, that was rampant. Like,

**Mike:** That's crazy.

**Darrell:** did not care. They, they, they hated trees. Turned everything to paper.

**Mark:** That's

**Mike:** We needed [00:10:00] Captain Planet.

**Darrell:** that's kind of, that's kind of where we're coming from, right? We're coming from that background where we had to create Like, we didn't have any assistants.

**Mark:** Yep.

**Darrell:** People who knew you best would probably be able to help you create something, but for the most part, it was in your own head, and you had to pull it out of yourself in order to create it. Whereas today, You can literally just type what comes to mind and it'll out something for you. That's the direction we're headed.

**Darrell:** What would you, what would you, what would you say is the best part about that era? Just the simplicity of it.

**Mike:** Okay. of it. all right. So who wants to take a ride first and be behind the keyboard? Oh, what are we doing?

**Mike:** You are gonna make your perfect AI or your weird in a weird science way. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, alright, yeah.

**Mark:** All right.

**Mike:** Sorry, I'm high.

**Mark:** I am too I'm trying I'm trying to keep control of the situation here because I

**Darrell:** Oh,[00:11:00]

**Mark:** right? I think I'm floating.

**Darrell:** he wants to do, he wants to do computer work. This is a podcast.

**Mike:** code.

**Mark:** So here we are us three behind Darrell's brand new PC computer that he got at Circuit City Okay.

**Mike:** Circuit City.

**Mark:** it's a,

**Mark:** Circuit City whatever, whatever, whatever. It's a

**Darrell:** It's a Toshiba Satellite. It's a Toshiba Satellite. I

**Mark:** it's got 2024 technology inside of it there. it looks like it's a 1995.

**Darrell:** think my I don't think my computer will turn on.

**Mark:** Oh, okay. Well, there you go. Yeah. Honestly. Yeah. And the screen might be kind of like poor too, but whatevs. Here we go. We're going to play with it. All right. You know what, Darrell, you're gonna sit behind the chair first because it's your computer anyway, so we might as well let you just

**Darrell:** Let's do it.

**Darrell:** Okay, Let's do it.

**Mark:** constraints, dynamics, freedoms of your life that you have, add them all up together. Right? Enjoy them. Now [00:12:00] find parts of that lifestyle right now that you probably want. I wouldn't say to improve, you'd want some help with, like, I wish I had an extra hand for this or whatever for that. This is where

**Darrell:** Okay.

**Mark:** is where I want to, like, frame it for you. You know, we could make a sex robot, sure, but we'll do that later. You know, we'll do a sex robot

**Darrell:** So, do

**Mark:** something

**Darrell:** you want me to

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** Do you want me to Google it?

**Mark:** no, what I want you to do is just like

**Mike:** Make it up.

**Mark:** it up. Yeah. I mean if it starts off with a

**Mike:** You're the coder.

**Mark:** you're the one sitting behind and you're like, okay, you know what if I had it my way This is how I would make my Ai Whatevs, you know, if you want to think of

**Darrell:** okay.

**Mark:** of it like Star Trek.

**Darrell:** I got one for you.

**Mark:** think of it like

**Darrell:** I got one. I got one. I got

**Mark:** Okay, type

**Darrell:** Yeah, I'm building I'm building the individual, right? So, something Actually, looking Like you [00:13:00] said, looking at yourself, right? What would you like to change? And something that's a pet peeve of mine, and something I always hate,

**Mark:** Okay. Yeah.

**Darrell:** but I do it all the time, I think we're all guilty of it, but I feel like mine's the worst.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** is, wanna not be a procrastinator.

**Mark:** Oh, how do you

**Darrell:** So, so,

**Darrell:** do you put an AI solution to not procrastinating? Okay. All right. That's freaking hard. That was a little too high for me. Hold on. I'm at a 7.

**Mark:** Yeah. You are at a seven. Okay, so how would, all right. The first thing I would do weird science style is I would take a picture of someone who was always on time and put it in the scanner. person

**Mark:** person would probably be who is always on time, who is never late. There's gotta be a public figure out there that's always on time and who is never late.

**Mark:** There's gotta be that one. There it is. Okay. What's his name? David Goggins. Right? That, that, [00:14:00] that guy that that,

**Darrell:** that guy's awesome.

**Mark:** just runs everywhere and doesn't sleep and just. You know what I'm talking about that. He doesn't he

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

**Mark:** runs everywhere and then curses all the time. All right, so I'd scan him because he'd be part of the program So that's part of your code right there

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** little bit of a David Goggins. All right, go for it

**Darrell:** You guys, you know who you gotta put in there too is Simon Sinek. For, for stuff like that.

**Mark:** guy the guy that The inspirational speaker guy the motivational speaker.

**Darrell:** Yeah, mhm.

**Mark:** scanning him into the printer So you need a little bit of that All right in your life. All right. So there you go. I wanted you to keep holding on to that So hold on because I want to look at it from a different view for a quick second

**Darrell:** Simon

**Mark:** like as if this were star trek and you get your own commander data Okay, that's what that's how I want you to look at it.

**Mark:** Like look at the gaps that you want to fill in your life So there you go. So we're programming a david goggins in there. What's his name? Simon cynic There you go.

**Darrell:** Sinek I

**Darrell:** There you go. What [00:15:00] else do you want in there? You feel like we're building something that can destroy me. don't like it. We need a failsafe. need a failsafe.

**Mark:** at that, this guy. I wasn't even thinking on that level. I was just thinking about, you know,

**Darrell:** In case he gets, if he gets too smart. too smart. Then we need something to shut it, to shut it down.

**Mark:** Okay? Let me set the stage for you yet again. So keep thinking about all those little things, right? Okay? Before we type in the next part of your program or your code or whatever for your AI, there's a surrounding quote I want to say right now. If you ever all the articles in the news about AI at the moment, you might stumble upon a quote that reads like this. want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes. Okay, so I want to set the stage. That's how some people are thinking in today's modern day world about this stuff So

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** want you to

**Darrell:** Mommy?

**Mark:** some of that with you along the way [00:16:00] You could say no that doesn't apply to me, but just know that your surrounding peers thinking like that too.

**Darrell:** So what is your fail safe? What are you going to code in there or other things? Hello, We're on summer break. So the kids are up late.

**Darrell:** fine. Don't worry. I can I can I can crossfade So, I'm trying to think because I like what you presented, but wanted to focus on that before moving on to the next part about Fail Safe. So you want

**Mark:** driving.

**Mark:** the pur, the pur, the purpose of a, of AI is to do something to, to allow you to do something else, right? So I want AI to do my job that I can spend more time with my family. Amen. Can we get an amen of that? I think that's what everyone

**Darrell:** Mm-Hmm.

**Darrell:** Not everyone because not everyone is in that same dynamic. But I think a lot of people would share in most of that as a as a [00:17:00] a feature. Okay, so to do your job. So you spend more time with your family. How do I what you said? From the fact that from how i'm on the surface i'm interpreting it as this You will replace you now you don't have a job. Mm

**Mike:** this is,

**Mark:** You get where I'm going with that?

**Mike:** this is what I would think.

**Darrell:** hmm.

**Mike:** Yeah, you can't have them do that because why are they your employer still gonna employ you? Yeah, that technology is available, right? Yeah So what I would want is and I think this is probably more feasible. You know how you have like a life coach or say a coach for your Say you're trying to work out right And you want to a personal trainer, right?

**Mike:** But there's more than just a personal trainer. There's one that actually coaches you that coach your diet, what you're, you know, how many calories you're supposed to burn, what sets of exercises, how many to do all that stuff, right? [00:18:00] I would like some, something similar to that. And a life coach For my actual life, right?

**Mike:** I'm gonna input. Hey, one of my goals is to Minimize work or be efficient with work Right be efficient because I still have to do it. You know, I want to spend more time with family. I Need to do 50 percent of the chores in the house Right get really really specific stuff like that, right? You And then it learns.

**Mike:** It learns what I'm capable of doing. I don't know how, but, you know, so it's gonna tell me,

**Mark:** there.

**Mike:** you know, it, it, it adds structures and reminders where you don't have to actually take the time to plan it out and think about it. Right. Because even, like, say for instance, brushing your teeth, you need to brush your teeth in the morning.

**Mike:** Right. But you wait, you know, let me just look at my phone real quick.

**Mark:** Hmm.

**Mike:** That's nothing bad with that. And all of a sudden one hour goes by and you're still on your phone. You haven't brushed your teeth. [00:19:00] You haven't started your day. Right.

**Mark:** something

**Mike:** this thing will,

**Mark:** do you think something is small? What if I don't outsource it to AI? What if I say I Outsource it to you set an alarm clock every 12 hours 6 a. m.

**Mike:** but I have to set the alarm clock.

**Mark:** You want it to automatically happen

**Mike:** This thing actually reminds me you have, you know, Hey Michael,

**Mark:** Yep. Okay.

**Mike:** it would be advisable to start prepping the dishwasher. Yeah.

**Mark:** want to go

**Darrell:** personal Siri.

**Mark:** but his AI has a sexy voice.

**Mark:** You know, it was like, hey, Michael, I was like, oh, so there you go.

**Mike:** Yes. Yes.

**Mark:** your

**Mike:** Right.

**Mark:** your AI is like that detailed. All right.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** crazy. Okay. All right. You know what? We're gonna collaborate this one. So we're gonna throw all this stuff in. So you're, we've thrown in some images into the scanner. Mike's added a few more lines in there saying I wanted to do this like this automatically and then it's gonna learn my routines. You know, [00:20:00] we've identified the fact that we don't want it to replace us from doing the job. want it to make it

**Mike:** No.

**Mark:** at our job kind of thing, right? So there we go.

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah.

**Mark:** so let's stay along those boundaries and well, we can deviate because it's fun sometimes to break the system. But we'll see how this conversation keeps going. All right, what else would you want to add? Darrell's been hijacked from the keyboard. Mike's taking it. Boom. He's like, no, we need to add this. We need to add this. This is good because this is how the movie went. And then a girl came out of nowhere from the bathroom and then shit hit the fan. And they thought

**Mike:** freaking horny teenagers, man.

**Mark:** that don't know how to control us. You know, a cybernetic sex robot or, you know, super powered thing. Yeah, shit hit the fan quick for them before the story resolved. So here go. Keep collaborating. What else are we doing? Mike's taking the keyboard. Go on, keep, keep going. What else do we need to add to this thing? Darrell, I'm coming back to you, by the way, because the failsafe needs to be there. We haven't even talked about

**Darrell:** Yeah, and [00:21:00] that's what I'm trying to think of, what's a good failsafe.

**Mike:** you know, getting kind of creative. And you never know, if we can't reel him in, Mike's gonna get too creative and shit hits the fan. Okay, so, go on, Mike. You got anything else that you wanna, you know, type into the system? AI to assist with stuff.

**Mark:** know, again, I gotta set the

**Mike:** No, because I, I, yeah,

**Mark:** day world that you are, where your pressure points are in life, for real,

**Mike:** yeah, yeah.

**Mark:** full time worker, and all the stuff that you do in between that stuff. What is like one other thing that's in there? It's just like, I want that, I want that to help me out because I think the common denominator amongst us three is that we would like to have more time with our boom, so you know

**Darrell:** Well, more time

**Mark:** To

**Darrell:** do the more important things to us.

**Mark:** time to

**Darrell:** Right?

**Mark:** underscore blank to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's the common denominator I'm getting, so

**Darrell:** I, I feel like Mike's building this nice elaborate AI and I want to like some sort of like, like maid robot.

**Mark:** my, because I can see.

**Darrell:** Go clean the

**Mark:** Mike's is like,

**Darrell:** [00:22:00] house.

**Mark:** in a totally like all knowing omniscient AI that's

**Darrell:** How should I live my life, AI?

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** is like Darrell's

**Darrell:** do?

**Mark:** come here.

**Darrell:** I'm like, I'm like go wash the dishes. wash the dishes.

**Mike:** Well, it's because with that kind of stuff, you have to have a robot. We don't have the technology now for a robot. Right.

**Darrell:** Yeah, I know.

**Mark:** guys. This is for fun. We because you know what?

**Mike:** Oh, so we can make a robot? Shoot. Shoot.

**Darrell:** window

**Mark:** is making robots at scale anyway with tesla and all that shit. So why not?

**Mike:** So we're going true weird science where we could

**Mark:** look, we we want

**Mike:** plug up a Barbie doll. We plug up a Barbie doll

**Mark:** That's why I said you're

**Mike:** and then,

**Mark:** That's why I wanted to set the stage. Kind of weird science style.

**Mark:** You're behind the desktop keyboard

**Mike:** shoot, we gotta think now.

**Mark:** we're,

**Mike:** think now.

**Darrell:** Mike's gonna get real weird with it, man.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** show, alright?

**Mark:** 21,

**Mike:** nah, nah.

**Mark:** and

**Mike:** We still could be in a [00:23:00] family.

**Mark:** This is a 21 and up family show. I like that. That's what we

**Mike:** Nah, we, we,

**Mark:** I like that.

**Mike:** Can you rub my wife's feet? And then mine.

**Darrell:** This is mine.

**Mark:** All right. Well then, as you think about it, cause Mike's going to get another turn. I'm going to take the keyboard. Here we go. I'm going behind the screen. see. Let's see. Darrell wanted a little bit of. You know, inspirational speaker and being on time. Mike just wants, you know, an automatic AI that re learns his routines over and over.

**Darrell:** Talk to me.

**Mark:** Talk to you. That's exactly what I wanted to get into. I wanted my own like personal, like, You know, a therapist, if you will, like your own little, like, counter to your mind, if you will. I don't know how, if

**Mike:** Hold on. Hold on. Are you saying we don't comfort you as friends? We're right here, buddy. You don't need a computer for that. Talk to us. Lay it on us.

**Mark:** I need, I need my, if you want yours to learn your behaviors and your routines, I want one, I want one to [00:24:00] learn my mind.

**Darrell:** He

**Mike:** No,

**Darrell:** to

**Mike:** because we're going to be honest. Go ahead, Darrell.

**Darrell:** he needs to confess the freaky stuff to the

**Mike:** Oh, I want to hear that.

**Darrell:** he's too ashamed of to tell

**Mike:** I need some excitement in my life.

**Mark:** Well, there, there was that one

**Mike:** Oh ho ho ho ho ho!

**Mark:** Paddy's 2006 or whatever. It's 2007. That was, I caught a big whale that night. That was, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was, that was a good one.

**Darrell:** His

**Mike:** Yeah

**Mark:** his name is Ismael. All right. All right. So I grabbed the keyboard from you. I'm like, get out of here, Mike. Think about it. I'm, I'm doing this. I'm doing that. And I want, no, this is what I want. I want, like, An AI meditation app kind of thing. No, this is really what i'm all about I'm, like I want to like maximize the mind kind of thing like something that really like Exercises the mental if i'm gonna have AI be smarter than me, you know what i'm saying? Like if it should know Like if to your point mike, [00:25:00] I want it to like know my routine So I don't have to clock in my own timer manually that it just automatically knows want I want something that that can like Like sharpen the brain if you will. I don't know if that shit exists if that's for real

**Mike:** I I I I think

**Darrell:** They're called books.

**Mark:** I'm sorry. Watch

**Mike:** I was going the other way. I was going I was I was gonna say you need to do shrooms shrooms shrooms I've never done them, but I heard they unlock your mind

**Mark:** I've done them many times before, my friend, and I'm telling you. I have,

**Mike:** You have?

**Mark:** many times. I guess I've only told Darrell this about, to advise him. That if you were to ever do mushrooms, you must have a clear headspace. Because if your headspace is not clear, you're going to go downhill really

**Mike:** Hmm.

**Mark:** So,

**Darrell:** They have a bad trip.

**Mark:** a difference between saying I'm going to take shrooms on a Friday evening, because it's going to ease me into the weekend. I'm versus Tuesday night before work. a big difference in headspace. Trust me, because I've fallen victim to

**Darrell:** Cause you want it to [00:26:00] ease you into work Wednesday morning.

**Mark:** that is a big, big

**Mike:** I I heard I heard you can microdose, mushrooms now

**Mark:** was taught about that 20 years ago.

**Mike:** Yeah

**Mark:** the

**Mike:** Yeah, just like with weed and your usb pens man You

**Mark:** such thing as micro dosing

**Darrell:** So,

**Mark:** then. I didn't know that

**Mike:** Yeah, you just,

**Mark:** this

**Mike:** yeah.

**Mark:** of cannabis. So yeah, there's

**Mike:** Yeah, I heard you can microdust now. So maybe, hey.

**Darrell:** So, you know what then? Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take, I'm gonna get a picture of some psychedelic mushrooms, and I'm gonna have the scanner scan that in. And we'll see if it figures that part out deep, okay? Keyboard pass, back to you. Darrell, you're next. Go for it. we need a fail safe,

**Mark:** Do you think we need

**Darrell:** And what's this do?

**Mark:** all this

**Darrell:** Well, what's,

**Darrell:** we're punching into the system? well, it's going to be, it's going to be automated, right?

**Darrell:** What's gonna be automated? What it does

**Mark:** yeah, it's self learn. It's

**Darrell:** at some point, it's not going to need after a while. It's going to sell, it's going to self learn enough where it doesn't need to interact with us [00:27:00] anymore.

**Mark:** we're training it right now. Yeah. Yes. Yes.

**Mark:** Yeah. We're training it, right? It's learning. and you are here

**Darrell:** I'm thinking,

**Mark:** failsafe.

**Darrell:** I'm so high dude, I'm thinking about like, we need like, keycards and like we have to insert them at the same time to like fucking dismantle the brain.

**Mark:** this like as if this was nuclear war.

**Darrell:** I'm like thinking, I'm like thinking like Total

**Mike:** The nuclear codes.

**Mark:** We have to turn,

**Darrell:** Quade.

**Darrell:** time. Three, two, one, click. Oh man, I am, I am on it man. Kate Wayne. 4.

**Mark:** and land and think of a failsafe that would probably be needed. So, the keyboard gets now passed back to Mike. Mike is behind Darrell's desktop computer, his gateway, and his computer, whatever it is with an Intel, Intel Pentium 2 processor. No, I'm going to go way back. Let's just say it's an Intel Pentium.

**Darrell:** Pentium 2.

**Mark:** I know all the, all the tech geeks are going to be like, that doesn't have enough compute to do what you want to do. I'm [00:28:00] like, guys, being a little,

**Darrell:** That's really a good voice.

**Mike:** That was a good voice.

**Darrell:** Yeah, that was a good voice. I

**Mike:** Hey.

**Mark:** so Mike, you've got the keyboard.

**Mark:** You grabbed it away from Darrell because he's stalling on a fail safe. What do you want to do with it?

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Mark:** the fail safe responsibility on you. I'm just saying, what if, what else, that you've got the keyboard yet again?

**Mike:** So shoot, if we could do like the whole robot thing. I ain't doing chores. I ain't folding clothes. What are you talking about?

**Mark:** clap for at puff provisions, Mike. clap,

**Mike:** Dude, I hate folding clothes.

**Mark:** slow clap. All right, go on, preach, preach brother,

**Mike:** Yes. Yeah, man. All they're not only cleaning up the house. They're cleaning up the yard too.

**Mark:** the bathrooms.

**Mike:** Sorry, Gardner. You're out of a job. I got freaking

**Darrell:** You got

**Mike:** miss.

**Darrell:** Can

**Mike:** Yes. Miss Mason is helping [00:29:00] out now.

**Darrell:** Can

**Mike:** Mason. I'm going to make her look like a grandma too.

**Mark:** Oh

**Mike:** I don't need no sexy robot. I need a grandma. Lola.

**Mark:** someone with like

**Darrell:** and who

**Darrell:** through some stuff, right? Yeah,

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Mark:** I

**Mike:** Yes, exactly.

**Mark:** add?

**Mike:** Might even discipline me.

**Mark:** ooh,

**Mike:** Like, oh, oh

**Darrell:** What?

**Mark:** just

**Darrell:** Wait, what? Something was recording. I don't know. I

**Mike:** Yeah. Oh,

**Darrell:** okay. I will.

**Darrell:** ride on this, I'm just snatching this keyboard away from you, I'm excited.

**Mark:** Okay, so this thing is gonna be, look, it's gonna look like a Lola, a grandma, if you will. And it's gonna have all the attributes and the physical capabilities necessary to fold

**Darrell:** else? Clean bathrooms.

**Mark:** Cook dinner. Clean bathrooms. What I want this one to do now that we've kind of modeled it in this direction. We mind you this

**Darrell:** stuff that we just programmed into it. It's an inspirational speaker. What else did we say?

**Darrell:** Hold on, I gotta step away just for a second, okay?

**Mike:** Go for it.

**Mark:** See, this is what real life is. This is what real life is. This is what we do.

**Mike:** He needs that. He needs AI to help him out right now.

**Mark:** out right now. That's right.

**Mark:** He needed to outsource that task to AI so he could come back and do this. This is how the real world

**Mike:** Exactly.

**Mark:** so he doesn't need to be here anyway. He can just hear this after the fact. Okay. So, we're modeling our AI to look like Alola, a grandma, beautiful, sweet looking grandma, but that can discipline you if you're out of line. Capable of [00:32:00] doing all the folding of the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

**Mike:** Yes. Trim the hedges.

**Mark:** If someone that knows your routine this robot knows your routine and can tell you to your toothbrush and all that jazz, and What else be an inspirational speaker so motivator if you will I like

**Mike:** Inspirational. Motivator. Oh, yeah,

**Mark:** all right My next thing to add to it would be the physical part Like it's also like your PE teacher your gym coach or

**Mike:** yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're a true coach. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**Mark:** your aerobics instructor if you like to lift weights, then it's your spot, right?

**Mark:** It

**Mike:** yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Mark:** to add

**Mike:** Or for you guys, like for your jiu jitsu coach, right? Yeah,

**Darrell:** Oh,

**Mark:** Jitsu

**Mike:** yeah, yeah.

**Mark:** Imagine if this, you know, AI robotic grandma that can cook, clean, and do all of that stuff, can also like, knows every move in the Jiu Jitsu library, and can teach that to you, [00:33:00] and train that with you in repetition in the garage. At level one,

**Mike:** Mark,

**Mark:** not level 10. don't want it to break my

**Mike:** rotate your hips three degrees. Yeah. Yeah.

**Mark:** get off,

**Darrell:** oh boy.

**Mark:** your back. Stand up. Don't be a bitch.

**Darrell:** You can't, you can't, can't teach her Jiu Jitsu. I

**Mark:** I can. What are you talking about? We're going out there, Darrell. We've just, we've gone far already because Mike is happy that he got his robot and he, we're modeling, we're not leaving, right?

**Mark:** We're going

**Mike:** Grandma.

**Darrell:** I need a robot to help carry the kids upstairs when they fall asleep on the couch.

**Mark:** that.

**Mike:** what we just said.

**Mark:** just said that

**Mike:** That's what we just said.

**Mark:** outsource

**Darrell:** So I had to step away to do that. I,

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** to do that so

**Darrell:** I don't know how many times my, how many more, I don't know how much more my lower back can take that. I mean, I don't know.

**Mark:** Dude, that's what I'm doing right

**Darrell:** These kids are only, these kids are only getting bigger.

**Mark:** I feel like sometimes my back is going into like a, a curb formation because I carry both girls, one on each arm, and they're both various

**Darrell:** Like, [00:34:00] scoliosis.

**Mark:** I got a nice cute little 20 20

**Mike:** You think, you think a

**Mike:** here that I'm carrying up the stairs. So I'm six year old, the weight of a six year old is going to mess up that titanium spine of grandma? I don't think so.

**Mark:** See,

**Darrell:** titanium alloy.

**Darrell:** Alloy. Titanium alloy.

**Mike:** You know it's made, this is the stuff that they used on Apollo 92.

**Darrell:** Oh yeah, I know.

**Mark:** Oh man.

**Mike:** That's the same stuff on the spaceship. Yep. Yeah!

**Mark:** Kevlar, softer than silk. That,

**Mike:** Yeah!

**Mark:** our AI robot. That's cool. Alright, so, so, that's what I need too. I need, I need an AI robot that has the physicality to be my personal trainer and to do the physical stuff that I don't want to do. Just like that, carry my kids. Because then I could be here present in the moment at the Puff Provisions podcast instead of stepping away. You could have AI'd it. Mike?

**Mike:** Yeah, Darrell, get that [00:35:00] AI.

**Mark:** example. It was

**Mike:** get,

**Mark:** that this,

**Mike:** get that.

**Mark:** this was timely that that that that happened, that you needed to do that. Because that's in the spirit of tonight's conversation. Now that I'm done, I'm passing the keyboard back to you. Are you back with us and have you landed or are you like, From a seven to an eight

**Darrell:** I'm, I'm up there, but I, I, I've got something, I've got something, alright? So we need a failsafe, because, we need a failsafe, we need a failsafe now because you want to teach us Jiu Jitsu, right? So it's only going to learn, and at some point, you're not going to be able to beat that thing,

**Darrell:** skynet exactly. So,

**Mark:** Go on go

**Mike:** failsafe, I have a heart monitor that I will wear, if my heart stops beating, that thing explodes. Wait, you don't you want it to save you?

**Mark:** don't you want to be alive after the

**Darrell:** No, and then me, if, no, if, I mean, yeah, well,

**Mike:** Like Baymax, like Baymax, like it'll save you.

**Darrell:** Yeah, but, I mean, there's, at one point, at some point, there's gonna be a time when it can't save [00:36:00] me. as a failsafe, it just wipes it. If I go, it goes. Because, remember, it's a piece of me, so people can harbor secrets and

**Mark:** wait a minute.

**Darrell:** information.

**Mark:** talked about

**Mike:** What kind of secrets you got, Darrell? The head

**Mark:** you're

**Darrell:** right? Someone could hack that robot

**Mark:** have

**Darrell:** get to where you live.

**Mark:** AI to talk about my emotions and this guy's got shit to confess.

**Darrell:** It, no, you can. can, but it's strictly yours. So anything happens to you, that thing shuts down.

**Mark:** Okay. That's what I wanted to get into in detail real quick So you set the stage that once my heart

**Mike:** up.

**Mark:** know right?

**Mark:** That's why I wanted to reset the stage You're saying in the logic in the way in the logic

**Darrell:** And,

**Mark:** the code is just if my heart stops Boom. That's really the, that's the logic.

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** What were the conditions? Wait, wait, wait,

**Mike:** I think you might be too high.

**Mark:** What were the condition, are there pre existing

**Darrell:** Hey man, you guys, [00:37:00] can

**Mark:** how does your heart

**Darrell:** you,

**Mark:** it, whatever? Like, are you concerned that the AI is

**Darrell:** if anything happens to me, yeah, if anything happens to me, that robot's gone.

**Mark:** Okay, so

**Darrell:** So you're, so wait. Because mind you, this thing is around you 24 7, right? So it probably sees you doing your business, going to the shower, right?

**Mike:** Wait, wait.

**Darrell:** That's all, that's all in memory, right? And

**Mike:** why do you have it in the shower with you?

**Darrell:** hey, I

**Mike:** is it in the bathroom?

**Darrell:** it's on security patrol protocol, right? It's walking around keeping the house safe.

**Mike:** Security protocol?

**Darrell:** right?

**Mark:** Master.

**Darrell:** Let's let the boy watch. It's

**Mike:** robot. It's not the family the family doesn't like.

**Mark:** not

**Darrell:** hmm. They can,

**Mark:** where they had that. What's

**Darrell:** it's not Jesse.

**Mark:** the

**Darrell:** No,

**Mike:** Yeah. Alice.

**Darrell:** Alice. No, it's not Alice.

**Mike:** Is it Alice or Rosie? Rosie.

**Mark:** Alice was Brady Bunch.

**Darrell:** Rosie,

**Mike:** Rosie [00:38:00] Alice Is is from

**Darrell:** yeah, we just dated ourselves

**Mike:** Brady Bunch. Brady Bunch. Yeah.

**Mark:** But no,

**Darrell:** yes,

**Mark:** it's his own it's george jetson's personal robot. It's not the

**Darrell:** because

**Mark:** All

**Darrell:** said it, you said it yourself, takes your attributes, qualities that you are lacking or want to improve and it's going to be this part of you. So pretty much your better half, right?

**Mark:** I

**Darrell:** My better half, when, my better half when given the proper tools is very dangerous. No one else can stop it but me, because only I know.

**Darrell:** Wait, are you, are you, are you assuming that this thing's going to kill you? It might learn too much. And it's like, dude, I got to stop this guy, you know? And so if I go, the AI goes

**Mark:** would

**Darrell:** for this, for everyone's safety.

**Mark:** What do you think would happen? Let's go with this. Let's future proof your logic. Okay,

**Darrell:** Yeah. I'm thinking, I think,

**Mark:** think? Your ai robot would be doing on a daily basis to learn That far To [00:39:00] cross that line of harming you.

**Darrell:** well, I'm saying, well, I'm, I'm thinking like. It's gonna be exposed to me and so it's constantly learning. There's not gonna be like, okay, let's sit down and talk and you can learn, right? It's everything, seeing what I do, from what I say. So this robot's constantly learning. That means it's learning at a higher rate than how we learn. So it's, it's, able to faster.

**Mike:** Well, okay. I'm with you.

**Darrell:** you're in Mark saying like, okay, I'm going to use it to train jujitsu. Well, guess what? That's what it's going to do is going to start learning your moves and knowing the counters for them.

**Mike:** So you want the robot to die because he's better than you in jiu jitsu? Did you hear that? No,

**Darrell:** This has gotta go.

**Mark:** to that code that you could put in place so you don't have to go that far. You could be like, okay, if

**Darrell:** needs to go, Mike.

**Mark:** this move and my tendency and I do [00:40:00] it, make this mistake and number of times on the 11th time, it'll tell me how to fix it. We could, you know, code that part in. you wanna do that instead of like playing this all or nothing approach of go boom.

**Darrell:** Well, so, is that, we're gonna throttle how fast it learns? Wouldn't that go against what we want it to do?

**Mark:** No, I'm

**Mike:** necessarily throttle how it learns, but it's, it's, it's,

**Mark:** failsafe in there.

**Mike:** the main qualifier is that it's there to enhance your life, right? So it's,

**Darrell:** Mm hmm.

**Mike:** that's why you tell it, hey, you know, after the fifth move, and I'm not executing well. Go ahead,

**Darrell:** I'm

**Mike:** ahead, go ahead.

**Darrell:** I'm also worried that my life is going to be enhanced so much that it's like, I can't do anything else. I'm going to go.

**Mark:** mean it, you mean it makes you

**Darrell:** I'm going to go get some milk.

**Mike:** Yeah,

**Mark:** I'm going to run the milk protocol. I'll be right back. nah, man. All right,

**Mike:** The Alice can't replace your sexiness. So

**Mark:** That's

**Darrell:** true. [00:41:00] That's true.

**Mark:** true. That's probably

**Darrell:** That's true.

**Mark:** wanted it to be, you know, an unbecoming, innocent Lola like attribute, because if it had, if it was a six foot five, pack robot, With a deep voice, but you know, could dance to all of Michael Jackson's songs. You know, Mike would feel threatened too, and he'd want it to go boom. I think he

**Mike:** Oh, yeah, get out of here get the hell out of my house

**Mark:** he,

**Mike:** Blow your head up

**Mark:** allowed in his house. No. So here we

**Mike:** Put the key in the back of the neck turn boom

**Mark:** we're not going to convince Darrell otherwise, at least not for the moment. So I'm just going to be at peace with it. And I'm going to pass the keyboard now from him to you, all of these things that we've just added up all together. Which is there anything you'd like to add? Notice how I said add and not subtract or take out. We're not taking anything out because you know what, I'm just going to throw everything in there until we're at peace. So,

**Mike:** Well,

**Mark:** we need, so

**Mike:** I would hope[00:42:00]

**Mark:** keep stacking it up.

**Mark:** I would hope that if the robot AI You Mm

**Mike:** takes the trash out better than me, that it doesn't blow its head up. Sorry, I can't, I'm tripping out on that. You're doing the chores better than me. Oh man, anything to add? Anything to add? No, I'm pretty content.

**Mark:** with that.

**Mike:** Yeah, you know, do the dirty work. I want it to do the dirty work. To be loosely inspired by both of your recent vehicle purchases, I want it to drive me anywhere and everywhere. Oh,

**Mark:** I will add that to the code

**Darrell:** Yes.

**Mark:** I'm done driving. Even

**Mike:** a chauffeur. You want it to be a chauffeur.

**Darrell:** Yeah, you have to teach you how to put gas.

**Mark:** teach you how to do all of that,

**Mike:** You want a chauffeur?

**Mark:** don't, I, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna look out the window again. While I get to the destination.

**Mike:** You don't like driving?

**Mark:** Well, I

**Mike:** You don't like driving?

**Mark:** That's probably because of like my behaviors like completely changed post covid. I rarely [00:43:00] drive

**Mike:** Sure, sure, yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

**Darrell:** you? Or, do you want to ride your robot AI? into like a, it turns into like a horse or something, right? With like jetpacks and shit.

**Mark:** me

**Mike:** Now you gotta do it piggyback style.

**Darrell:** Take it back,

**Mike:** Ha ha ha ha

**Darrell:** legs. Cross your legs.

**Mark:** mike

**Mike:** ha! We're going! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bur bur

**Mark:** you said you wanted to just be like, you know, like An innocent kind of looking robot or like a non becoming robot like a grandma. I am thinking about Rosie from Jetsons Because that is the most harmless visual that I have at the moment is is that

**Darrell:** Mark wants to

**Mike:** bur bur. Wanna ride Rosie? Yeah. With all the clamps. With all the

**Mark:** guys knew how capable she was if you watched the old cartoon.

**Darrell:** had, she had [00:44:00] wheels. Like, she had like,

**Mark:** had

**Darrell:** she had like office chair wheels for feet.

**Mark:** extender arms and all that stuff, and she,

**Darrell:** No, not extended arms. She had clamps.

**Mark:** she had C grips,

**Mike:** clamps.

**Mark:** she had really hardcore C grips. Hardcore. And I remember there was an episode where she went crazy. There

**Darrell:** She broke everything.

**Mark:** in the Jetsons where she went completely,

**Mike:** is.

**Mark:** went completely haywire. And the episode was about stopping her, kind of thing, cause she would, she short

**Darrell:** Ah, too bad they didn't have a thing. They don't have a failsafe.

**Mike:** They didn't have a failsafe.

**Mark:** so what I would add to that would be Darrell gave me two choices since it was do you want it to drive you or do you want to ride on it like a horseback? Can I have both? I'd like my my

**Darrell:** it.

**Mark:** to know how to drive a car and i'd also

**Darrell:** That's gonna cost you extra.

**Mark:** Okay, let's play constraint. Let's play real world constraint then choose one or the other you cannot have both

**Mark:** my

**Darrell:** so,[00:45:00]

**Mark:** play economy with you. I'll play the economics of it all if you're telling me it's going to cost extra, the value proposition for me then would How fast does Rosie run? Can she go 0 60 in like X amount of seconds? Cause I

**Darrell:** yeah. She is Rosie.

**Mark:** the vehicle to keep

**Darrell:** If Rosie has a long range package, she can have, can cover about 250 miles a given day before you need to charge Rosie.

**Darrell:** Don't ride the robot. He wants to ride

**Mike:** What's wrong with you? Don't ride the robot.

**Darrell:** Can you imagine if you got robot jacked? Like someone's like kicked you off your robot?

**Mark:** But my robot, my AI would know it's me, and then if it's not me, it'd turn off. So,

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah, yeah,

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** not, that's my

**Mike:** yeah. It's got,

**Mark:** ID or bio ID or whatever the terminology

**Mike:** it's got face ID.

**Mark:** and all

**Mike:** Face ID. Oh, [00:46:00] what

**Mark:** it. Yep,

**Darrell:** Ka bluey bluey. Boom.

**Mark:** Here's the thing. All right, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'll

**Darrell:** Cabo.

**Mark:** would like it to drive me around because that means my AI knows how to drive every vehicle planet Earth has ever made. It could be an electric vehicle, a hybrid, or a gas car. It's just like, if we need to go, my AI knows how to take me In any situation, it's my bodyguard, Whitney Houston, Kevin Costner, you know? Oh, I want it to be

**Mike:** if,

**Darrell:** bodyguard! Oh God, there you go. Sky,

**Mark:** I want to program bodyguard

**Darrell:** right there. Skynet.

**Mike:** That, you're getting close to Skynet there. You're getting close to Skynet.

**Mark:** something to protect me? is that Skynet?

**Darrell:** well,

**Mike:** Yes,

**Darrell:** it's,

**Mike:** protection. Oh, you know what ultimate protection is? You have to stay in the house because of the elements outside and then now it doesn't let you out the house. And all you can eat is vegetables.

**Darrell:** a prisoner.[00:47:00]

**Mike:** You're a prisoner.

**Mark:** You really

**Mike:** Because it computed,

**Mark:** you think

**Mike:** it did a little computational analysis and it

**Mark:** this piece of code is Skynet?

**Mike:** don't know, how you gonna stop it?

**Mark:** Passing the keyboard to Darrell.

**Mark:** How you gonna stop it if you're telling it to bodyguard you? Icarus, Such

**Darrell:** right?

**Mark:** you don't teach it that.

**Darrell:** getting so close to Skynet. you're just dabbling and dancing around the idea of Skynet.

**Mike:** man. I'm gonna call you Icarus.

**Darrell:** Yeah, fly

**Mike:** t

**Darrell:** too close to the,

**Mark:** here we

**Darrell:** too

**Mike:** To the sun.

**Mark:** jeez.

**Darrell:** Yep.

**Mark:** we

**Mike:** Icarus. Ugh, nope.

**Mark:** is with you.

**Mike:** Nope, nope.

**Mark:** want, you want a John Wick bodyguard robot AI thing to drive you and protect you and know jujitsu. John Wick That is badass and scary at the same time, I admit.

**Darrell:** Yeah

**Mark:** to be

**Darrell:** It's learning, it's

**Mark:** Can you imagine one day? Okay, let's load it [00:48:00] up. Again, everything.

**Darrell:** What hap

**Mark:** right. How would you,

**Mark:** What, what happens Sorry, I gotta get this thought out What happens When, what happens when It determines That you are the inefficiency God, I was gonna allude to that as well. You are saying it in a different way from how I'm gonna set the stage, but we're going with that theme. Stay there, okay?

**Darrell:** Mm Mmhmm

**Mike:** Can you imagine One day your future selves and I'm talking at future puff provision at future puff provisions Darrell You've just built this entire body of work It's deployed at scale and everyone has one of these to their own liking under these custom protocols that we've described tonight, whatever they want. Can you imagine your future self? How would you feel, your future self? Mike, you're in the kitchen prepping a scoop of ice cream for yourself. Darrell, you're prepping a cup of coffee for yourself in your kitchen. Just across the way you see your [00:49:00] AI in the corner, just there. All quiet, all stoic, kind of, you think, oh, kind of a little off today. What are you thinking in your head if you see your AI across the room? And it's quiet more than usual. Well, I would yell at it and tell it to give me some ice cream. Why am I doing, why am I pouring myself some ice, my own ice cream? Hell no,

**Mark:** man.

**Mike:** I'm gonna be on the couch. Rosie. Rosie. Hello. Hello.

**Darrell:** Wick, Darrell's is like Kaboom. Alright, so what are you thinking, Darrell, if like you're, you know, somewhere down the line, it's been maybe one or two years since you've had this AI robot, or whatever it is. It's been two years, and all of a sudden, just for some reason, you're pouring coffee and making it. You look across the way across the room. It's a little off. you thinking? What are you doing? It'd be I don't know. Run a diagnostics check. Maybe a, a formatting of some sort.

**Mark:** It's not a

**Mike:** your brain.

**Mark:** maybe it's not connected to the Wi Fi. Who knows? [00:50:00] so it didn't okay

**Mike:** Router's down.

**Mark:** it's at

**Darrell:** down.

**Mark:** too crazy then because I thought there was another kaboom fail safe that was gonna

**Darrell:** I would have it restart the router so that it could update.

**Mark:** You would have

**Darrell:** How

**Mike:** Come

**Mark:** would have

**Mike:** the router.

**Mark:** router so it could update. Okay

**Darrell:** how crazy does that sound, right? Let's

**Mark:** What you know what?

**Mike:** Yeah, I'm gonna be too freaked out.

**Mark:** Yeah

**Darrell:** run some, run troubleshooting diagnostics.

**Mark:** would be too freaked out if it was in control of the wi fi Because then it had capability of disconnecting your devices that are around you. It could cherry pick devices are on or

**Darrell:** Mm hmm.

**Mark:** over time.

**Darrell:** What? I'm thinking

**Mark:** if it what if it like, you know, you're thinking like part of this like on a holistic level is like You know also help me in the process be more efficient Like what we've been saying the buzzword was efficient earlier on in this conversation tonight, you know So

**Mark:** Mm hmm. Mm hmm. with like electricity usage.

**Mark:** I've got a bunch of lights on here in this room right now You know [00:51:00] is Rosie gonna scold me and just automatically turn things off around me That shouldn't be used kind of thing. Like do I get the energy efficient? Rosie or do we not add that feature? We just have, you know, regular Rosie or regular John Wick. don't need energy efficient minded Wick or anything like that. Because what I'm trying to say is like, you know, they can turn your device on or off from the Wi Fi. Is that

**Darrell:** That's scary.

**Mark:** Exactly.

**Darrell:** wouldn't allow it that much control. Mm

**Mark:** All right. So, do you think after seeing all of this wild stuff, wild, but some of it's not, it's tangible, could happen. Where was I going with this? How do you think, do you think,

**Mike:** Where are you going?

**Mike:** you think after all is said and done, this will improve your daily life? Yeah, hell yeah.

**Mark:** How so? Because you got the ice cream got served to you instead of you doing it yourself? What, what, what do you

**Mike:** Yeah, man. Dude, I told you I hate folding [00:52:00] clothes.

**Mark:** true.

**Mark:** hate folding clothes. Okay, so the way that's where I landed with at puff provisions, Mike, this is the to get to the bottom of it His ai is the one that does the house chores Efficiently, that's what

**Mike:** Hell yeah.

**Mark:** first thing that comes out of his head first. for you Darrell exact same

**Mike:** Shoot, I don't even have to be half AI. I can just freaking hire someone. I should. You know what? I need to get rich. Bro. Bro. Yeah. Hell yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Mark:** That's how it works

**Darrell:** would love, you would love the Philippines, Mike.

**Mark:** your one dollar would go far. Why are you still here?

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mark:** goes far even in 2024.

**Darrell:** you would love the Philippines. So

**Darrell:** 2024 that dollar still goes far. You could, that water, it would be poured in your mouth. that, so it's, are we, it seems like our, our reasons are changing a little bit more. From efficiency to convenience,

**Mark:** [00:53:00] Yes. They're both, they're,

**Darrell:** right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Darrell:** You know? know? Like, like, hell yeah! I don't like folding!

**Mark:** what I, this is kind of like, like, of it all is like, I want to know what, what you'd want AI to do first. And for Mike, it is

**Darrell:** I think if it's, if it's that, I think if it's that, then I feel like we're a few steps away, further away from Terminator, from Skynet, if it's just that.

**Mark:** Well, for him it is. I'm not, you could be, you

**Darrell:** Right? But, yeah, I could like teach him to be like John Wick and be like, okay, it's go time. You know?

**Mike:** What? You're gonna have to remind me.

**Mark:** it.

**Mike:** Skynet was a government program?

**Mark:** No,

**Darrell:** They're

**Mike:** No.

**Darrell:** company.

**Mark:** So when,

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** his name,

**Mike:** Private.

**Mark:** the arm when the first Terminator went back to 1984. They recovered the arm, and that's how Skynet, that was the birth of Skynet,

**Darrell:** That's how Skynet, the [00:54:00] chip and arm

**Mark:** found the chip and the arm, and that stuff was obviously advanced at the time, so they started to, like, understand it and scale it out.

**Mark:** Not realizing the danger of it.

**Darrell:** They were,

**Mark:** boom. It was just a, it

**Mike:** And what, what was the purpose of Skynet?

**Mark:** honestly, it was just another freaking com,

**Mike:** It's not to fold clothes.

**Darrell:** full close, it was just another computer, honestly, it was just another tech company. they were going towards AI,

**Mark:** the AI

**Darrell:** like, like they were doing AI, but they lost control of it and it ended up nuking the world and then humanity.

**Mark:** day.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** day.

**Darrell:** Yep. So

**Mark:** that's,

**Darrell:** was the whole, like, that's the high level view of Terminator.

**Darrell:** know, I hate to be, conspiracy theory and all that stuff, but you know, it kind of goes hand in hand with how this exciting, exciting world of new toys to play with and things like that. But you think you could ever get there if we're not careful? I think we're almost, we're, I mean, we're building [00:55:00] the foundation of it right now. Like this is, this is everything that's going on now. I mean, I just suck, I just. overheard a commercial on one of the podcasts I was listening to about they're advertising they use AI. I forgot what software company it was, but they're like, but they're like, we, like

**Mike:** I

**Darrell:** when they in their commercial, oh, it was NPR, but in their commercial, they're just like, you know, so I forgot the company, but so and so product now, now with AI. Like, as it, like, as if it's a selling point now, you know, it's, it's the

**Mark:** been a mark.

**Darrell:** the appeal of it all.

**Mark:** term for a

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mark:** it still continues to be

**Darrell:** I, I don't think they've really scratched the surface on, on that. I think there needs to be more, more research done, more learning.

**Mike:** think we, we were like, we're like a hundred years away

**Mark:** a hundred.

**Mike:** from,

**Darrell:** That's, I,

**Mike:** yeah.

**Darrell:** I think that's a good number, because then they're gonna start, God, what if [00:56:00] we're wrong, like, what if we're 20 years away?

**Mark:** I think

**Mike:** Nah, we're a hundred, we're a hundred.

**Mark:** first thing is first was We do have an episode on the Puff Provisions podcast called Year 2083, and that was really to set the stage for, are we going to Mars? So maybe by the year 2083, which I know isn't a hundred years from now, it's less than that, but significantly less, but do you think maybe in the year 2083 to complement to that episode, are we on Mars? And with, you know, such robust versions of AI that they are at least rosies that we've made them that way. I think that,

**Darrell:** Hmm,

**Mark:** I think that's there. I think we

**Darrell:** yeah.

**Mark:** people on, on the moon, or, you know, perhaps on Mars by 2083, and we have very sophisticated bots like a Rosie from Jetsons. I see that. I could see that. Because hear me out.

**Mike:** So 60 years from now?

**Mark:** hear me out I recently went to a restaurant in the Bay Area. I don't know if you could even [00:57:00] credit AI for doing this, but maybe you could. A robot was serving me all my food and all my drinks.

**Mike:** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Nah, that's not AI. No.

**Mark:** just, that's straight, like, programming.

**Mike:** That, that's, it's basically a robot vacuum. The technology of a robot vacuum,

**Mark:** So,

**Mike:** know. Nope,

**Mark:** I don't know. I've been watching a lot of like those robots that Elon Musk is coming up with they're very sophisticated, you know,

**Darrell:** Oh, the Tesla Bot?

**Mark:** I don't know. We'll see at any rate this one.

**Darrell:** be so scary. It's gonna be like a robot you can ride. It'd be like, fast like a Tesla.

**Mark:** man bet you it's got a death grip because it's super articulate like that thing could probably squeeze your neck off. Honestly, honestly

**Darrell:** [00:58:00] Yeah.

**Mark:** But yeah, this was fun and it needed to be done because You It's not changing. It's only getting crazier with this AI stuff. I'm learning day by day. know you guys are too in your own way shit changes It's all weird stuff saying with AI included or whatever Darrell said so it's good to be cognizant.

**Darrell:** Dude, it's crazy. It's like, It's like back in the day when you'd watch like I mean, I'm dating myself. Like, you know, Saturday morning cartoons. And they have a commercial. They have a commercial for cereal. Right? Right? now with more frosting or something like that. It was kind of like that. It was like framed that way, you know.

**Mark:** true. And now Let's let's go with the modern day thing right now before we close out tonight. You're present Where everything that's around you got some of you have the latest iPhones out there Again, like you guys got some pretty cool new Teslas out there and stuff like that What is the one impressive thing about technology right now that you like [00:59:00] AI or not AI related?

**Mark:** I don't care in this modern day world versus because you set the stage earlier tonight. We came from a different era Late 80s

**Darrell:** Mm hmm

**Mark:** a different time snapshots of then it into now. is one thing in the modern day year 2024? Where it's like, okay, that's pretty impressive stuff. Because I have one already. Your car is doing all of that automatic sensing of everything around the

**Darrell:** Hmm.

**Mark:** that more amazing.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** that to be more amazing than the actual auto driving feature. Or auto parking

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mark:** to be perfectly honest. To have that level of sensory intelligence around your vehicle. That's Knight Rider shit. That's straight up Knight

**Darrell:** it's Knight Rider. Yeah, isn't that it's Knight Industries I if I only had a button for power boost to jump

**Mark:** it's a night

**Darrell:** it'd be Knight Rider.

**Mark:** All you need is the

**Darrell:** Yeah, it's Knight Rider, right?

**Mark:** button and

**Darrell:** So they do have

**Mark:** You're good

**Darrell:** That's it. They [01:00:00] have It has, so the self, the full self drive comes with a couple features. Right, one is the full, the full, the main part is the full self drive. Then there's the auto park. The auto park.

**Mark:** Again,

**Darrell:** is like,

**Mark:** like I totally am impressed by that, but it's just that sensing of

**Darrell:** literally need zero driving training. Right? To do it, because you just drive It measures the fricking parking space to distance and knows how to turn the wheels. So you literally, you're just sitting at and then, and it can probably park better than you,

**Mark:** that's true.

**Darrell:** right?

**Mark:** in tight tight spots

**Darrell:** Cause

**Mark:** spots

**Darrell:** I've, I've done, yeah, I've done parallel park and I've done just a regular back into a parking spot. And both times I feel like it was more efficient than how I do it.

**Mark:** right

**Mike:** not me. I'm a man. Men, men drive.

**Mark:** Darrell, you're a boy. Sit down. Sit down.

**Mike:** You know, I, I, it, I, I put, I put a, I put a, when I, [01:01:00] when I drive that thing, I put a piece of paper on, on the on the screen. I don't need it. I just, I,

**Darrell:** Cover it up. You drive by the feel of the road. You

**Mike:** Exactly.

**Darrell:** open the, you drive with the window open so you can smell where you're

**Mike:** Yep. I point out we're due west. We got to go west.

**Darrell:** You gotta go west.

**Mark:** Alright,

**Mike:** Yep.

**Mark:** Puff

**Darrell:** He's, Mike's,

**Mark:** are you impressed with in year 2024 in terms of the technology? A piece of technology that thoroughly

**Mark:** Like, yes, this is is I appreciate this. This is the future

**Mike:** like we're, we're, yeah. Yeah. This is the future. I don't know, man, it's nothing has dramatically, and I'm also kind of up to date with

**Mark:** That's why I

**Mike:** technology and all that stuff. So

**Mark:** because you are up to date You have you have the laundry list of fresh of fresh,

**Mike:** so a [01:02:00] lot of the stuff has just like, has been a gradual change. So it's hard for me to place something as like, Oh man, this is really. Changed

**Mark:** tell

**Mike:** because I haven't I've never felt it.

**Mark:** It's just this

**Mike:** Yeah,

**Mark:** this is future the fact that I can talk to you

**Darrell:** Oh yeah,

**Mark:** Or you two,

**Darrell:** this is,

**Mark:** guy. Oh my god. I thought there's a fourth

**Darrell:** this is, this,

**Mark:** is the future like I'm

**Darrell:** this, this, this is Star Trek.

**Mark:** I'm

**Darrell:** This is Star Trek.

**Mark:** screen. And then I'm talking to people in high resolution in different locations. And it's an up to date conversation. This is Star Trek shit, you know? Yeah, to me This is Seriously,

**Darrell:** It is.

**Mark:** me.

**Darrell:** We just need to learn how to teleport

**Mark:** hmm.

**Darrell:** and we're Star Trek.

**Mike:** So if you once we get teleportation that's gonna be the one I'm gonna be like, oh, yeah.

**Mark:** this

**Mike:** Oh, yeah, that's it

**Mark:** What if we had teleportation? That is

**Darrell:** But then

**Mark:** be a follow up.

**Darrell:** I'm thinking, but then we're thinking, I'm thinking early day, [01:03:00] like early day mistakes, right? Like pretty much we're going to be the fly. Remember that movie with Jeff Goldblum?

**Mark:** into

**Darrell:** That's what he was building. He was building a teleporting pad and the fly flew in his pod, and then that's how he turned into the fly because the, the, his DNA's

**Mike:** That's a old movie, dude

**Mark:** movie, and you've just dated us

**Darrell:** But, but that's what, but that's what I'm thinking is like, okay, yeah. Teleportation cool so I can get from house to your house. We probably won't even need cars. We we're just gonna teleport. Everyone's gonna have a teleport tele pad in their, what was their garage would be now the teleportation room or something.

**Darrell:** ability to teleport, then cars wouldn't exist. Exactly.

**Mike:** No, you still you would still need cars probably

**Darrell:** I feel like that's kind of how the evolution of technology is, is it eventually replaces

**Mike:** Would you need cars? No, you wouldn't. You wouldn't need cars.

**Mark:** why would you If I

**Darrell:** Why,

**Mark:** don't need airplanes

**Darrell:** would you,

**Mark:** to

**Darrell:** would you rather, [01:04:00] yeah, would you rather get somewhere in seconds or in hours,

**Mark:** I already know the answer to

**Darrell:** right?

**Mark:** So that's the only

**Darrell:** Even, even to fly from

**Mark:** know what? AI is bullshit. We don't have anything. We need teleportation. That's when we know we've made it. This

**Darrell:** Re teleportation,

**Mike:** We need teleportation.

**Mark:** AI. We need

**Darrell:** yeah.

**Mark:** So everyone in Silicon Valley, everyone

**Darrell:** know how much more time, how much more time you would have in your day if you didn't have to drive

**Mike:** Well,

**Darrell:** somewhere?

**Mike:** days I don't go outside my house, so.

**Mark:** Well, it'd be different. It'd be different.

**Darrell:** is that a cry for help, Mike? Is that a, is that a cry for help?

**Mark:** Mike

**Darrell:** Remember, you're, you're, you're in the, you're in the safe space. You can share.

**Mark:** Mike

**Mike:** Yeah, there are some days I don't step outside my house.

**Darrell:** You don't need to touch grass.

**Mike:** Not for any significant amount of time. Not more than like half an hour.

**Mark:** right

**Darrell:** Is that why it,

**Mark:** you know what I'm imagining right now? Him saying that is

**Darrell:** what,

**Mark:** the scene from with Quagmire coming out after a [01:05:00] few days and he's got a big right

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** That's what it is. He's got a big right arm.

**Mike:** Ugh.

**Darrell:** the sunlight,

**Mark:** can't stand the light, the daylight, and you've got a big right arm.

**Darrell:** it's gotten, it's gotten so bad that he has to wear shades inside the house

**Mike:** Yep.

**Darrell:** regular, the regular lights are too bright.

**Mark:** Dang.

**Mike:** Stings.

**Darrell:** you know, he's gonna start to lose the pigments in his skin, cause of the, he's gonna be turning into like a white pasty guy.

**Mike:** For sure,

**Mark:** Alright, so we need teleportation. This episode was

**Darrell:** Teleportation.

**Mark:** was then, huh, non threatening, AI, non threatening, non issue. We don't have teleportation, because that would be the real danger. Because imagine if someone could just teleport to you out of nowhere, that catches you off guard. That is some ninja shit, am I right or am I wrong? Like, if you

**Darrell:** That's like a new wave,

**Mark:** a country in an instant and send an armada, you just teleport them,

**Darrell:** like, hack, hack their,

**Mark:** more

**Darrell:** their teleportation and [01:06:00] like one day like some rushes just appeared in your living room.

**Mark:** It's like you were just doing your thing, then all of a sudden, boom, Command and Conquer. Right there.

**Darrell:** That's like a futuristic Red Dawn. Remember that movie?

**Mark:** and Conquer style right there,

**Mike:** Freaking old man, dude.

**Mark:** This guy's gonna start talking about Hunt for Red October

**Mike:** You have a wall of VHSs still? Like what the hell? Red Dawn?

**Darrell:** Red Dog with Patrick Swayze.

**Mark:** you guys all return your VHSes to your blockbusters? still have one floating in your house? Don't lie.

**Mike:** Make sure to rewind them.

**Mark:** You better not have.

**Darrell:** Be kind rewind.

**Mark:** you have one?

**Darrell:** Yeah, no I don't have anymore. I don't have

**Mike:** Ain't no VHSs around.

**Mark:** if there are any

**Darrell:** You know, the thing too is like, They have Redbox, right? I mean, that's like, probably like the last form. Yeah, it's like the last form. Like it's the last thing that's left of that era is Redbox, I feel like.

**Darrell:** They're still around. I think some, but I mean, I'm not, you know, I know,

**Mark:** doesn't [01:07:00] doesn't

**Darrell:** I know, I, I know my, my father in law still uses it, so I'm sure there's a, there's one somewhere,

**Mark:** How much do those cost?

**Mike:** old people.

**Mark:** How much does that cost?

**Darrell:** I don't even know, but I mean, Netflix doesn't even do their DVD rentals

**Mike:** Nah, they stopped. They stopped that.

**Darrell:** they stopped a while back, right, so, is like, the last, like, piece of it, you know,

**Mark:** that's true. Well gentlemen, thank you for taking us into tonight into the holiday weekend Happy birthday america by the time this gets published america will be how many years old?

**Mike:** Proud to be an American.

**Darrell:** do math right now.

**Mark:** 024 minus 1776 equals, oh no one has a calculator out, I'm not doing the math, geez.

**Darrell:** I thought you were doing it That's why I was

**Mike:** I thought she was doing it for us. That's 350 years, right? That's

**Mark:** two?

**Darrell:** You

**Mark:** ha ha ha.

**Mike:** years. 348. 348 years.

**Mark:** 248. 248.

**Mike:** [01:08:00] 248?

**Mark:** 2024

**Mark:** yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 248. America

**Mark:** 248. Oh, I'm high. That's why I can't do math. I'm high. Puff

**Darrell:** have your, your,

**Darrell:** You're what? it's your computer to do it for you. There's a button for a calculator

**Mark:** tell me, Mike, how much. It was

**Mark:** I'm a man. Mike can park his own car, he doesn't need AI, Darrell go,

**Darrell:** Mike does math in his head.

**Mark:** go boom, and I talk to the computer and cry. So my brain feels better. That's it, puff puff, and peace. [01:09:00]
