**Robbie Wagner:** [00:09] What's going on, everybody? Welcome to Whiskey Web and Whatnot, your favorite show about Whiskey Web and sometimes whatnot with your hosts RobbieTheWagner and Charles W The 3rd. Those are our Twitter handles. Charles William Carpenter III as the full name, of course, because we can't go an episode without saying it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:31] Yeah, you enjoy it too much, and I don't want to take that. I don't want to remove that joy from your life. There's so little left.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:36] Yeah. And on that note, let's have some whiskey.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:40] Let's start drinking. Sounds so depressing. We have to drink whiskey.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:46] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:46] All right. There we go. What you don't know is I've actually already drank half this bottle.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:53] So it's from Reddit, I guess. Is that how you found it?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:56] Yeah. So there's a subreddit called bourbon, cleverly enough, and they do barrel picks, and they send out, like, this email where you choose which one you want to try to be a part of, and they randomly select from that and let you buy and blah, blah, blah, blah. So it's kind of a cool thing to get different stuff. So this one is from the company called the Nashville Barrel Company. Spelled with two L's. No, just kidding. Just one because that was the big barrel. There's one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:24] Oh, I thought you meant Nashville.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:26] No, I was messing with you.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:27] There's two L's in Nashville.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:32] Hopefully you don't get that wrong. So this is a rye, as it mentions an, our bourbon pick. It's 106.40 proof, nine years aged, and the mash bill took me a little while to find that 95% rye and just 5% malted barley. Yeah, not bad. All right, let's see what we got.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:51] All right. Has a very specific smell that I'm trying to put into words.

**Chuck Carpenter:**[01:58] Okay. It's got, like, a mustiness.

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:02] Okay. It smells like you remember, like, I don't know if you had these book fairs at school as a kid.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:09] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:09] And they would bring in all these books, and you would open them. They're like new books, and they would all have certain smells, depending on the book. They didn't all smell that way, so it must be something about the process of printing.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:20] Yeah, they were, like, the chemical for preserving.

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:23] That's what this smells like.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:24] Yeah. That's funny now that you say that.

**Robbie Wagner:**[02:27] In a good way, but yeah, it's.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:30] Like the new car smell of books.

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:32] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:34] Not like books that you would get from the thrift store or something that smell like mothballs. That's a different smell. Okay. Well, yeah, I get that. Definitely. If that's a good descriptor, I couldn't really get there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:50] Got a little bit of spiciness.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:52] Yeah. Like a nutmegy cinnamon for me in the beginning, and then has a little maple. It's got some heat, though.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:00] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:00] And then peppery.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:02] Yeah. It's something of, like, a spice blend. One of the ones that isn't the common main ones. I don't know which one, but some spice. I can't put my finger on is what it tastes like.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:13] Star of anise or something like that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:15] Yeah, sure.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:16] I just like saying that one. Right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:18] Yeah, I think that's in that the Chinese 21 spice blend or something. I don't know. Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:23] That one has a lot of interesting stuff.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:25] Yeah. Anise is in a lot of like it's in Pho and different dishes.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:31] Yeah, a lot of Indian dishes, I think, too have things like anise and coriander, and I'm very infrequently made my own spice blends for that kind of stuff. It's not enough to actually remember.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:43] Oh yeah, for sure.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:45] It's good, though. It's tasty. Yeah. It doesn't linger too long. That's nice. I still stay with mine. It's got a little cinnamon and nutmeg in the beginning for me.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:54] Feel like it's a little bit different than a standard rye, but not massively. It's got a lot of classic rye characteristics. Very spicy. I like it. I think I would give it a six.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:08] So how you don't like it enough? Well, it just showed up on your door one day, so you don't know anything about pricing or anything for it. So you are given a very generic independent review in that way. I don't know. I was leaning more towards a seven, at least as of right now. I'm particularly enjoying it, sipping. It's got some hug, but it doesn't linger too long. That's pretty nice. Like you said, it's very well-rounded in terms of having a little sweet, a little bitter, little woodiness, little like it feels like it's deep in its flavors. And I actually have a little water today, too, so I'll add some to try that. But I think I'm going to go seven. I think I am enjoying this.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:45] Okay, fair enough.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:47] No one is wrong on this show.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:49] Yeah, except when we're wrong about no one's wrong about whiskey.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:53] Yes, exactly.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:53] Let's say that the important part.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:55] Yeah. The best whiskey is the one you like.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:58] Yes.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:59] All right, so web things. Internets. Plural. Let's talk about those.

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:05] Yeah. So we're somewhat tech-adjacent here today. We don't have like a heavy technical topic or anything, but we wanted to go a little bit into different conferences that we know are coming up, how you might find some, and what we think the benefits are and all of that stuff. So there used to be not really a great way to find them. It was kind of word of mouth or their own SEO of what are you searching for to find my conference. So it was kind of few and far between that you would find these JavaScript conferences, and you'd be like, oh wait, that one happened over there. That's cool. I wish I had known about that. I would have gone. But now there are a lot of aggregators, and I feel like people are doing better about mentioning it on Twitter and things like that. A couple of them that seem to be pretty good, and they have stuff that's not just JavaScript. They have like every dev conference type of thing, like different frameworks and languages and all of that different stuff. There's a Confs Tech and a dev events that you can go to and find these. And I confirmed they do have RenderATL on them, so they at least know about that one. But I think a lot of people know about that one at this point. So yeah, I don't know if they have every conference, but I found it a nice way to filter through them and see all that stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [06:27] Yeah, I'm looking at it now. I wasn't familiar myself with Confs Tech. Yeah, I believe I've seen dev events before. It's nice because you can look at by subject matter and by location, so it's got a few filter options in person or online, or both. So that's kind of neat.

**Robbie Wagner:** [06:48] And you can filter by ones that have an open CFP, a call for papers, so you can see like, oh, if I'm looking to speak at a conference, I can just go find all of these and apply to all of them.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [06:59] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [07:00] But I guess, taking a step back, why does anyone care? Why would you want to go to a conference? What's the point? Right? I think there's beyond the obvious. It can be fun and a good way to network with people and get to know your team better or whatever. Going to any conference that's in a different area or potentially somewhat different subject matter than you're used to is going to help broaden the way you look at things and give you new insights to bring back to your team of ways to do things, how to improve all of the things, et cetera. So I guess I'm trying to think, have I even been to any that aren't EmberConf? I'm not sure.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [07:38] Well, that's interesting that you speak to that and not.

**Robbie Wagner:** [07:42] Well.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [07:42] Participated in that on your own. I've been to many conferences over the years, so I do agree with you, though, I think you're on the right track. I think there's a lot of different ways, let's say, going with your team and having it a be like we've gone somewhere else. We're doing this event about the subject matter that we're all working within and we want to learn something together, but we also want to take some time to bond and network within that ecosystem in person a little bit, rather than just like a Discord or Slack server or whatever. I think those are certainly good things. If you go on your own, you won't have the team bonding exercise, but you have individuals with similar interests obviously going to the same conference and just getting different perspectives, watching the talks there, maybe getting introduced to something new. I think that's another valuable aspect, and like learning something. Right. Regardless. Hopefully, you have, like, one or two takeaways minimally when you go to a conference. Either that you're familiar with the subject, or you're trying to learn about something new altogether. And I think they can be both of those things. Go into another ecosystem and figure out another way of doing things that might benefit you as well. And then, yeah, obviously, there's the aspect of where it's hosted. Sometimes that's just a cool thing. I want to go to a conference, and it's in wherever city been there nice to explore. A lot of conferences are smart about integrating local aspects into the conference as well, so that's another fun thing, too.

**Robbie Wagner:** [09:10] Yeah. And you can't forget the most important thing. You get the potential to build your entire wardrobe for the year while you're there because everyone's giving away free shirts and stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [09:21] Right, yeah. The swag, which I remember when I first started going to conferences, I was just like, yes, I want every T-shirt and bag and whatever else, and this is so cool. And then eventually you end up with like two drawers full of that stuff, and you're like, I don't need it anymore, I have to purge.

**Robbie Wagner:** [09:36] Yeah, well, usually the stuff isn't of high quality, so it wears out before, like, I just have to throw them out anyway.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [09:43] Right. Not the Ship Shape stuff, though. That stuff lasts forever.

**Robbie Wagner:** [09:47] Yeah. Because we buy good stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [09:49] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [09:51] So some of the conferences coming up that we are pretty excited about RenderATL, I think is the well, it's not the first one, so let's come back to that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:00] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:01] The first one chronologically is VueConf US. I don't know if you've heard about it, but it is in New Orleans.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:09] Are you asking me?

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:10] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:12] No, I haven't. Just because we've been a bit out of the Vue ecosphere for a little bit.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:19] Yeah, of course. Evan You is speaking because he's the Vue guy, and it's in New Orleans. I just thought that would be a cool trip because New Orleans is fun, jazz is fun, all of that kind of stuff, and yeah, I don't know much about it other than it's there and okay. Another speaker. Is Sebastien Chopin or.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:40] Chopin.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:41] Yeah, Sebastien Chopin. Because I believe he's French.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:44] Yeah, right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:45] He's like the guy in charge of Nuxt, I believe.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:50] I see.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:50] So yeah, you can hear from those guys. There's some other speakers, but I'm not really into that community as much, so I don't know if they are prominent or not.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:59] So if you're interested in the prominent smell of pee, I would go to that one. That's another thing I know about, at least the French Quarter kind of smells like urine everywhere.

**Robbie Wagner:** [11:12] That happens in some of the best places.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:14] That's true.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:16] Sorry. Anyone who lives in New Orleans, I just had to make that joke.

**Robbie Wagner:** [11:19] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:20] Yes, and then next chronologically is RenderATL, as you mentioned, May 31 to the second. It's in Hotlanta. I actually haven't spent any time there. I've only been through the airport. So I'd love to be there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [11:35] I've been there. I don't know that I've been downtown. I've been around Atlanta for a day or two. But, yeah, I haven't been in the city. Katelynn has a lot of family there, so we're going to make, like, a week of it and visit some people and do all of that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:50] It's a large conference with an incredible number of speakers, too, which is another interesting aspect of it. And obviously, we've had a few of them on this show. I kind of have, like, a mild personal goal to try to get as many of those 80 speakers that we haven't already spoken to on the show, but I better turn up that effort a little bit. But yeah, because there's a lot of very interesting people there. So it would be great to have different if you happen to listen to this and you are a speaker there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:18] That's no one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:20] No one that's a speaker there.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [12:21] Listens, maybe somebody we've already interviewed is, and they would recommend us maybe to someone else who is also a speaker. Or if you want to come back, I'm not opposed to that. We can chat about this specific conference and what you want to talk about or whatever else. But yeah, so I would love to have more of the speakers on this show. That would be a lot of fun. And then meet up with them in person, and then yeah. You mentioned here in the show notes that they do have legit swag called hardware.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:51] Legit.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [12:52] Legit. That's almost like saying le shit. I just look le shit. Sorry. It's called, like, yeah, Cache Money Records. Except for it's cache, spelled C-A-C-H-E. So I ordered one from last year. Took a while got the shirt, and then I wear a medium, typically, but this was like a medium child's size. And then I tried to get an exchange, and they just didn't have them anymore, so they just gave me money back. So maybe going there, I'll be able to be like, yes, I'd like one. Can we make sure it fits me?

**Robbie Wagner:** [13:23] Yeah, they have a bunch of cool stuff. They have, like, a cologne for whatever reason, and then they have some baseball jerseys and a nice hoodie and Mona Lisa with a gold chain with some other, I don't know, developer-centric things around it to make it more techy. But it's definitely not as lame as sometimes you get stuff from conferences.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [13:48] Right. Yeah. It's got some personality, and it's kind of cool. Like the hip-hop vibe to it. The original Cash Money Records. Like, that was Master P, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [13:57] You know, I don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [13:58] Yeah, I think it was Master P, and I think they're from New Orleans. Don't quote me on that. Anyway, so that correlation is kind of interesting. So, yes, we're excited and interested. Sounds like Robbie's definitely going. I better go then.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:12] Yeah. Still figuring out the details, but definitely going I don't know if this is still going to happen, but I was talking to the people at RenderATL about potentially doing a crossover podcast thing with them because they have their own podcast too, and chill with them, talk about the conference more. So we might go more into detail on that if we can hook that up but we'll see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:35] So many things I learned just by showing up and recording a show with you. No idea.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:40] Hey, I'm busy. I don't have Slack on as much anymore. What are you going to do?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:45] You're so productive. That's great. See, I learned about conferences in a leadership Slack, tech leadership Slack that I'm a part of. It has a conference channel as well. It's called Rand's Leadership Slack. So it's not a secret, and anybody can pretty much join. Highly recommended if you're interested, has technical leadership channels, but it also has plenty of people who aren't directly in technical leadership. So there are plenty of individual contributors and people that are in the product side of things and all over the place. So it's a really interesting community with all kinds of I mean, there must be hundreds of subchannels there about Sim racing and job searching and certain type of JavaScript and Python and just everything in between. Nice plug.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:33] Yeah. So the only conference I've been to, I guess, is EmberConf. So excited that's coming back up. I've just been down a rabbit hole for a long time in Ember, and then when I actually would have considered going to other conferences, we had a pandemic for a long time. So I'm planning on going to other ones now. But of course always going to go to Ember Conf whenever they have it, for as long as they have it. So that is coming up. I'm unsure of the exact dates if we've nailed that down yet, but it's like July 20 and 21st, give or take. I don't know if it's like Wednesday, Thursday or Thursday, Friday, or what, but around those dates. And it's in Portland, which is always fun. I guess it could be hit or miss in July. Like sometimes, it's actually hot there now. I think it used to not get hot, but I don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:19] I don't know what's happening in the world.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:21] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:22] It's like the globe is warming.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:23] Tons of snow in California right now.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:26] Yeah, right. Maybe the Earth is changing its tilt and the axis, and now California will become Antarctica or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:34] Well, that would be hilarious for all the people that have spent millions of dollars for property down there, but.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:40] Down on the beach, and all of a sudden, penguins move in. Yeah. So EmberConf. Julyish?

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:46] Definitely July. Just I don't know if it's the exact dates, but anyway.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:51] And the dreams of the 90s are alive and well there, so that's perfect.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:55] Ember is not from the 90s.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:57] No, that's part of Portlandia.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:59] Oh. I never watched that the dreams of the 90s are alive and well in Portland. Okay, well, sorry, that's your loss. We could whatnot that a little bit. It's pretty funny.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:08] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:09] There's a special announcement around.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:12] We have been confirmed that we will be recording a live episode of this podcast at EmberConf. So I believe it's the second day, but again, we don't know what the days are, so we'll give you more details as we know. But it's going to be like a breakout session kind of thing. So there won't be a main stage thing necessarily happening. Right. It's just like choosing your adventure from these three or four things or something. So we'll be one of those things. We may or may not be on the main stage or in another room. I don't know if people have to sign up beforehand or like how they know how many you're going to what, but it is definitely happening, and we are trying to work out the logistics to see if we can get everyone to taste whiskey with us or if that's not going to be allowed. So if not, it'll be just us, but we'll see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:55] Interesting. I thought you were going to say, like, we can't bring whiskey in the building or something because I am definitely sneaking it in.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:59] We can have the whiskey and yeah, I think the problem is just if you're going to serve to over a certain number of people, you need to have an actual bartender or some kind of license or something.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:09] Oh, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to have all the audience sip along with us. Interactive. I love this.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:17] Yeah, this is great. We've done drink tickets before at EmberConf. You end the conference, and you have a drink or two, and then once you've used your tickets up, you're done. Just do that towards the end of the day and make one of the drink tickets be for this. And then you don't have to worry that people are like way too hammered or whatever because that's the main concern.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:34] Oh, I see. Yeah. Just the people who make friends with us will end up hammered. That's all. Because we'll obviously have extra.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:41] Yeah, the people we give free bottles to.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:43] Yes, exactly. At that point, you're going to have to drag some of your boxes out so we can give bottles away. Have them shipped out.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:51] Yeah, I'll start driving now. I'll take the Bronco. And it'll take that long to get there?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:55] Yeah, possibly max of 35, but it looks cool. So there's the special announcement. Love the interactive thing. Do you think we should probably have people on stage with us too? So we'll have to decide who are the appropriate guests.

**Robbie Wagner:** [19:09] Yeah, so I don't know, a lot of people have left the Ember core team or are not left. I guess that's the wrong word. Like they're on to other things for a while. Maybe they're coming back. I don't know. But who we would have on from the Ember core team? I'm not sure. Definitely, we should open it up to anyone that has questions about Ember or this podcast or anything they want to ask us. Like, we could have another mic out in the room or whatever, and people can ask questions or come up on stage, whatever, it doesn't matter. So, yeah, we're going to make it as interactive as we can because it would be really dumb for us to just shoot the shit for an hour with a bunch of people in the room. Like, people need to talk with us, or it's just kind of dumb.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [19:49] They get to meet their favorite celebrities in person and us.

**Robbie Wagner:** [19:53] Yeah, right. Yeah, we'll be there also turns out.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [19:57] All right, so back to conferences, I think we've yammered on about that, the real-time logistics of our show at a conference. Speaking of conferences, what else do you need to know? We need to know what?

**Robbie Wagner:** [20:11] So the last thing about EmberConf is it does have a CFP, and not all conferences do. I don't know if we mentioned it when we were talking about RenderATL, but all those speakers are invited, so you could not even apply even if you had the best application. There's no way. They would just be like, yeah, come speak here. So every conference is different, but a lot of them have a CFP. And if you're looking to get into speaking at conferences, highly recommend that you just start submitting to several of them. It's also good if you can get someone to review your work before you submit it. Make sure everything is as good as it can be. Everyone that has made it to speaking has had a lot of help along the way or a lot of luck, I guess. So don't be afraid to ask for help. Even we're around if you need help if we have the time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [20:57] Although you're the only one who successfully had a conference talk accepted.

**Robbie Wagner:** [21:02] Well, yes, but I don't even necessarily count it because it was virtual because of the pandemic. But I applied a few times before I ended up doing like a workshop and a bonus conf talk the years prior, and I finally get main stage, and the world shuts the fuck down. Yeah, that's okay, though. I can just go take a picture in front of the big Ember sign and pretend like I was speaking and then we can say that it happened.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [21:32] Perfect. Put that up on your LinkedIn Ember conference speaker as part of your yeah, so yes, ask you for all of the help. That sounds good.

**Robbie Wagner:** [21:41] So I think the last piece to conferences is like, all this sounds cool, right? But how do you get to go and not have to pay for it? Because they're expensive. Like unless you're speaking and they're paying your way there, it's usually flights are anywhere from a few hundred to like $1,000, depending on where you're going. And lodging can be anywhere from 150 to 300 a night, depending on where you're staying. So it's not cheap. And you have to be able to convince your company that it's a good use of one, letting you take your time to go do it so that you're off of work potentially for a couple of days, focusing on that and paying your way and paying for all that and your food and all that stuff. So a lot of conferences I've been noticing, it's kind of a trend, give you a convince your boss template. I don't know if you've seen those.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [22:31] I haven't.

**Robbie Wagner:** [22:32] But RenderATL has one. And it's like, examine these things about your team, like, what are the problems your team has, where are their knowledge gaps? What could be improved? Then it's like, look at these different talks we're having and the potential topics and try to map that back in to say, like, hey, we're having problem with XYZ. This person is giving a talk that's somewhat related to that. I think it would be a good use of our time to bring the team, get some outside opinions from these talks and be able to level up the team in that way. And just talking about professional growth in general, because most companies, if they can spend a couple of theoretically get a much more enlightened and leveled up engineer who's ready to take on higher challenges and things, then why would they not spend that money? They want to have their engineers be as knowledgeable and good at everything as they can. So they might as well spend a little money there versus they got to spend it somewhere because they want to spend it all before the end of the year for taxes. Right. So instead of spending it on like a lunch or something silly, spend it on this.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [23:41] Yeah, and something to bear in mind too, when you consider the compensation and benefits in your job search, is that lots of companies offer professional development budgets, and that can include conferences. So sometimes it's like books and online courses and or conferences, and I think asking those questions upfront or hey, you're already employed, good for you, and see if they have a professional development budget because it might already exist. And then the convincing is less of a concern. I know when I would manage teams, oftentimes, we have that same professional development budget. And when someone wanted to go to something, they bring it up. They talk about, kind of like you had mentioned, what they think the benefits are, and then sort of the ask on the return end is, okay, when you get back, why don't you do a little lunch and learn for the team? Just to kick start that conversation off within the team and sort of present to everybody some things you thought were valuable or maybe not valuable. Maybe you were like, well, they said that it was this kind of conference and it wasn't that great, but now I've learned ABC thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [24:56] Yeah, I think that's totally fair. It's the least you can do and the best way to bring that back to your team because if just you learn but everyone else has no idea about it, then why would they listen to you unless you've helped convince them?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [25:10] There you go. Conferences.

**Robbie Wagner:** [25:13] Yeah, we didn't really have a ton about conferences, I guess, here. So we can just move to whatnot at this point? Go to conferences. They're fun.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [25:22] -Yeah, they're fun. They're interesting. You're networking. It's important to like it's important to develop your network, I think, and in subject matters that you're interested in, it's a great place to do it and socialize a little. Don't stay in all side.

[25:36]Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [25:38] All right. What not? Well, I don't know what not? My brain is a little fried from whatnot. Because I what noted myself to Florida of last week because I was curious, what is hotter than the desert with more traffic and a giant mouse? Florida.

**Robbie Wagner:** [25:54] Is it that hot right now, though?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [25:56] It was pretty hot, actually. Yeah, it was mid to high. Eighty s and very high humidity, so it was quite warm and sticky.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:05] Yeah. Hate that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:26:07.050] Yeah. Not my favorite, but nice and sunny.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:10] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [26:10] I went to Disney World for a few days, so I went to each of the parks, animal Kingdom, the Magic Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, and Epcot.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:20] Nice. Did you do the Toy Story ride?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [26:22] Yes, we did.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:23] That's my favorite one, so I didn't.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [26:25] Really know what to expect. And we did the Genie+ thing, so there's certain long rides you can make reservations for. I guess it's like the modern Fast Pass. They don't Fast Pass anymore. Okay. So we did it for that. And when we were walking up to it, I saw, and I'm like, oh, this might be a little more than he bargained for, but let's see, both of my children were big enough to get on it, so I figured it can't be that crazy. Well, he loved it, so that was great. We did the Avatar ride, the one where you ride a banshee.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:56] I didn't know they had that one.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [26:57] Oh, yes. So in Animal Kingdom, they have the whole Avatar world, and they have a couple of rides in there, and one of them is like this VR-like experience. So you're riding a banshee, but you're, like, strapped into this thing, and they kind of make it more like 40 other senses. So when you dive down into a waterfall thing, they miss you a little bit. There's a lot of wind. The thing that you're on is supposed to be like the saddle on a banshee, and so it's breathing too, and especially when you stop and pause and it's breathing heavier, so you get that aspect. Yeah. It was really cool.

**Robbie Wagner:** [27:33] Yeah, I know. They had one that was like a hang gliding thing or something at one point, and they would span like orange mist so it would smell like you were going through fruit trees and stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:46] Yeah, you do smell like the jungle and stuff, too, in this, so yeah, it's a similar concept. It just happens to be specific to Avatar. They do still have that. What you're talking about? It's an Epcot. But I opted to ride the Guardians of the Galaxy roller coaster instead, and it was killer.

**Robbie Wagner:** [28:01] Nice.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [28:02] Very cool. It's indoor.

**Robbie Wagner:** [28:04] Is that new?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [28:04] Yeah, it's newer. I think it's the newest thing other than Tron, which is opening up like, in a month or so. And obviously, we didn't do Tron because it doesn't exist yet.

**Robbie Wagner:** [28:12] Yeah, I guess I haven't been in over ten years, so I guess everything is probably new this point.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [28:18] Yeah. So there is definitely some neat stuff. Like there's thing in Hollywood studios that's in the Chinese theater, and it's Mickey's runaway train. And that was actually really fun. The kids really like that. So it's not on a track. You're just in these cars that operate independently, and it's moving all around, and it's like you went into a cartoon. So it's like yeah. I don't know, it's hard to describe, but that's generally it. And that was really fun, too. Yeah. A lot of good rides. And, of course, we just did It's a Small World, things like that, too.

**Robbie Wagner:** [28:48] Yeah. Got to do the classics, do the teacups.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [28:51] Yeah. And in Star Wars, I actually didn't ride any rides this time. I was trying to get on Rise of the Rebellion, but it was like super booked up. And they have, like you can do the Genie+, but you actually have to buy an extra reservation thing for that. And then even that was booked up.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:05] Wow. So a little crazy popular.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:09] Indeed. So. Yeah, I guess. Oh, rides good. Genie+ thing not bad. Lots of fun. Had obviously this safari in Animal Kingdom is cool. It's been there forever. Food is real, but is kind of bad in general. There is one place called Tiffins.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:25] Yeah. They have cool experiences, though.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:27] Yeah. So the first night we did Tiffin's in Animal Kingdom, and that was like, gourmet, amazing. Super delicious. A bad way to start off. Probably the second night, we ate at Be Our Guest, hoping that my daughter could meet Belle. So, like, Beast and Belle. Well, first of all, Belle isn't there anymore, just Beast. And she fell asleep after the bread course.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:49] But doesn't she have her own castle there now?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:52] She has a thing next door now.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:53] She just is not there.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:54] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:55] Okay.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:55] So it's just the next-door thing, and they don't have her come over.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:59] That's dumb.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [30:00] And that was very expensive and not that great.

**Robbie Wagner:** [30:04] Yeah. I remember doing like when I was a little kid going and doing breakfasts and things specifically because certain characters would be there. It has nothing to do with the food. It's like, hey, you just spent $20 on one egg. But that's fine because here's the characters you wanted to see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [30:18] Right, exactly. We did a character breakfast with Disney Junior characters like Fancy Nancy and Goofy, and Vampirina, all the ones you know and love. Doc Mcstuffins. Yeah. I mean, overall, it was a good time. We stayed on property. I think that is key to reduce your transit time in and out of the park. And you can, like, oh, we need to take a break. Let's take the boat back or whatever and take a little nap before we make a run at it again. Because ten to 12 hours in a theme park is exhausting.

**Robbie Wagner:** [30:49] Oh, yeah. Ten to 12 hours doing anything is exhausting.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [30:52] Yeah, agreed. So yeah, in general, fun. But I was introduced to a I'm going to go beyond Disney, although Disney is the crux of things. I was also introduced to, I guess, is probably like one of the largest retirement communities in the country. It's called The Villages. It's. Basically, it's like 80 sq mi, multiple developments, 85 golf courses. It's a 55-plus community. So much room for activities.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:23] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:24] It's overwhelming.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:25] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:26] But then it's hot all the time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:27] It's hot. A bit hot. Cooler at night. It's a bit hot. I mean, if you like to do pickleball and have a lot of mediocre food choices and live music all the time, then you should move there when you turn 55.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:39] I mean, I'm about all that except for the hot weather. I can't deal.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:42] No.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:43] So not for me.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:45] No. Yeah, you'll be retiring in Wyoming or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:48] I mean, at this rate, I'm going to be in Canada because it's going to be hot in all of the US. So we'll see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:54] Right? That's true.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:56] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:56] Get yourself some prime Canadian property up north.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:59] Yeah, I'm going to live at Wes Bos's House. I'm just going to show up one day, be like, hey, I'm going to sleep in the basement for a little bit, and we'll find somewhere to live.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:07] I brought you some whiskey in my hands. And it's cold out here. Well, it's getting warmer, but can I come inside forever?

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:14] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:15] I brought my family.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:16] Yeah. I mean, we obviously can't ship him whiskey, so we'll just bring it to him in person.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:21] Yeah, it's pretty challenging.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:22] Yeah. I wonder if he's going to be at RenderATL because Scott's going to be there. He's a speaker.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:29] Is he also in Canada or no?

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:31] No, he's in Denver, I think.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:34] Okay. Yeah. I don't know. There are so many people. It's hard to keep up with. It feels like all of the Internet tech personalities have been invited.

Robbie Wagner [32:43] Oh, yeah. Like, if you have over 100,000 followers, you by default were asked if you want to speak, I think.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:50] Right. Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:51] That's the minimum, which where's the Primagen at?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:54] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:54] He's got to speak. Maybe he doesn't want to. I don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:57] Yeah. Maybe he doesn't want. I don't know. He doesn't really do the conference thing, right? Like, his spiel is the recorded outlet, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [33:07] Yeah, I guess. What's the point if everyone already knows you online?

**Robbie Wagner:** [33:11] Yeah. And what are you going to have? A green screen on TV? I guess he'd be good at live coding something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [33:17] Yeah, I would pay to watch that. Just someone doing insane vim stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [33:22] Right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [33:23] I remember when Toren did that at EmberConfand, everyone was like, Oh, that's like crazy shit. So yeah, I would watch that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [33:30] Okay, fair. Well, you should ping him and see if he'll ask them to ask him.

**Robbie Wagner:**[33:36] Yeah, I could. On that note, I guess I ordered the keyboard he uses, and I'm going to learn that, learn vim and then learn Devorak is the high goal. I may or may not do it all, but I'm going to start just trying and do that as part of some videos that I'm doing, too. Just kind of learn as everyone watches, see if I can do it or not.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:00] I hate failing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:01] There'll be a lot of failing.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:02] Sure. I can deal with a public humiliation personally. Yeah. So is that the Kinesis 360?

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:07] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:09] Okay. You'll have to tell me what you think.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:11] Yeah, I had the Kinesis Two or whatever, the one that's just like it, but it's not like split into two pieces. And I used it for, like, I don't know, a few days and then decided it was too hard and put it away. But I wasn't that committed to it at the time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:27] I see.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:27] And I don't know where it went now. I was going to get it back out and play with it and I was like, can't find it. I'll just get the better one. That is totally split it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:36] Yeah. I've actually been, like, wearing out the keys on mine, so I mean, I can replace the keys. That is also a simpler.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:43] Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:44] Yeah, but I mean, that's not fun. So if you like that keyboard, I would think about getting that keyboard. I really need a split one because I'm old and I get problems in my wrist, pain in my wrist.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:54] And the worst thing for me is the mouse. That's the extra high-level goal is. After all of that, if I can learn to control my computer with only the keyboard, that would be cool.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:03] That's true.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:04] But I think, honestly, the hardest thing would be websites because so many of them don't do accessibility, right? Like you're trying to tab through the stuff, and it's like not doing it at all well.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:15] That's how you know what sites aren't doing a good job in accessibility. Like, you eat the dog food on that. I don't know. I have the Lift for Mac mouse, and it keeps your wrist more upright, and you're not moving around a bunch.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:28] Yeah, we have the same one, right? The Logitech one.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:31] Yeah. Well, for those listening and may have any carpal tunnel issues or wrist pain, those are the ways that I deal with it. A split keyboard that tents up and that mouse.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:46] Yeah, it does help. I have the accompanying Microsoft keyboard that's like a little bit ergonomic it's not totally split, but it's like a little bit domed and it's like a gateway into an actual separate one. So I got used to that one. And the biggest thing for me was the keys in the middle. I would use the wrong fingers for let me see here. Maybe B is on the right side on the split one, but I would press it with my left finger or something. That was a big problem for a little while, right? Yeah, we'll see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:24] I think I have the opposite. The B is on the left for mine. And I believe I was trying to do the B with my right hand for the longest time and had to kind of relearn.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:34] That might have been it then, too. I'm not sure.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:36] Something like that. So you also are doing it wrong, I guess, according to the people who invented split keyboards.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:41] Oh, I do it totally wrong. This is going to be a huge endeavor because I use these fingers to type.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:47] Oh, wow.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:48] I don't use my pinky fingers are, like, useless because they're so weak. And then I don't know. So I use like three fingers on each hand to type, and I'm going to try to unlearn that because I won't have to move as far with the split keyboard. So maybe I can do it, but we'll see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:04] Interesting. So I guess you didn't take typing classes in school ever.

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:08] I did, but they don't come around and look how you're doing it. I can type really fast how I do it. I just don't do it right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:15] Oh, gosh. And a very strict teacher in that way that you needed to be following this specific technique. And so they would watch you and correct you.

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:24] Yeah, there were too many people in class. They would walk around, but you just have to pretend like your hands are in the right place when they're around there, and then they leave, and you're, like, typed it all really fast. It's fine.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:36] I thought the Virginia school system was supposed to be good.

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:39] I don't know about that. It depends on where you are in Virginia.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:44] Yeah. Were you in Fairfax County or no?

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:46] No, no, I was in Roanoke.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:49] Because that's the good one, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:50] Southwest Virginia.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:51] Oh, that's very different.

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:53] Yes. There was an entire wing of the school dedicated to agriculture and building stuff. That's how you know it's not in the city.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:03] That's why you kind of want a farm. But then the reality really dissuades you.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:09] Yeah, no, it's a lot more work than it should be.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:12] I feel like you should say y'all more.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:14] So I used to, but I purposefully got myself not to do it. I say like, you guys or whatever, things that aren't y'all as much as I can.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:26] Any other thing. Just remove that from your speech. Okay. Today I learned.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:32] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:33] I'm sure you've told me the Roanoke thing before, but I just kind of forgot.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:36] Yeah, I mean, growing up, I didn't leave a square two-hour radius. So, like, did college in Blacksburg, which is like an hour away. Went to the lake. It's like an hour away. Or Roanoke, it's all within that triangle there.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:52] Right. I mean, I wasn't totally different than that either. So I grew up in northern Kentucky, right across from Cincinnati, basically. It was very urban area, though. So different in that sense. While people in this like an hour south of us would say, y'all a bunch, not so much where I'm from. And skateboarded, took buses into the city, that kind of thing. But yeah, where else did I go? I mean, nowhere for the longest time. Basically, my first vacation was when I took a job at an airline. My first or second year in college, I can't remember it might have been the second year, and started flying to Cleveland just because I could for the day. And then, my first actual vacation was to the Bahamas because I had a job there, and it was free.

**Robbie Wagner:** [39:34] Yeah. Nice. There you go. If you want to go places for free, work on a plane.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [39:38] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [39:39] Although maybe not right now because they're hitting each other a lot and stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [39:43] Yeah, I hear it's much more challenging, too. So this was obviously like pre-911, so it was like security was hardly anything. Airlines had tons of flights, so as they called this non-revenue, when you're an employee, getting non-rev seats was a lot easier. You literally could just show up and get on a lot of flights. But now they've worked to really overbook and reduce capacity and cost and all those kinds of things. And so it's not quite as easy as it once was.

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:11] Make it sucky.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [40:12] Yeah. For all of us, really, as we know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:15] Yeah. So I have something I wanted to regress back to that we mentioned a couple of episodes ago. I mentioned something about MeUndies, and you were like, oh, there's some better options. We'll put a pin in that and then we never came back to it. So tell me about the better options.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [40:33] Okay. Yeah, because I had me on these for quite some time, but then I got introduced to this brand called, and it sounds crass, but it's very effective. It's called Saxx, and that essentially is the concept. So it has some of these better sweat, wicking, whatever materials, cotton blend, whatever. So it's very comfortable, but the design is different where it has like a pocket built into it for you to be in the sack for yours, and it's incredibly comfortable and, to be honest, kind of flattering. So it's a win-win. And they have some interesting designs. Or you can get, like, plain. I've gotten, like, five pairs of black ones or whatever else. And yeah, I just basically decided to get rid of all other underwear, and just because I'd wear them and then have to rotate into my MeUndies or whatever else, I'd be kind of disappointed. So I was like, Why am I even doing this? Just have enough of these?

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:38] Yeah. So I tried some that are a similar concept with a similar name of My Package. Have you seen those?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [41:46] I mean, it's very subtle. No, I haven't, but I'm guessing, like, a few companies have probably got onto this now.

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:52] Yeah. And so they were okay, but they just weren't as. Like I think the material of MeUndies is the best I found so far. So maybe that's the key, is if the design is right and the material is right, then it's good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:04] I agree with that. I think it does have to be the right material too, because, before MeUndies for years, I would do the Uniqlo has this AIRism brand of things, and it's about being sweat, wicking and very light and all of that. And that was pretty nice but a little too synthetic. And then MeUndies had a little more comfort to it. So the sax S-A-X-X, I believe it is.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:29] Perfect.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:30] Yeah, it combines those.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:33] Okay, got you.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:35] Yeah. I say give it a shot. I know you are always about finding the perfect thing and then just having 20 of those. This might be it for you. Right. Like, find the right hat, and I just only want that hat, and just give me all that hat.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:47] Yeah. I currently have, like, 50 pairs of MeUndies.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:51] Wow.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:52] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:52] So it could be a whole lot.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:54] That was it for me so far.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:56] Yeah. Well, it's kind of like the sweatshirt thing. You thought you had really nailed down the sweatshirt that you loved, and then you found something else that you also love now or maybe love better.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:05] Yeah, I mean, everyone's always putting out stuff, so if you don't try it, you don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:09] Where did you ever land on shoes? I always feel like you just do regular shoes. You never found, like, a shoe?

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:15] I found a shoe. Okay, so it's these. Like, J. Crew did some Nikes.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:21] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:21] Right. And every dude has these.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:23] Okay, right. But every white dude has these. Come on, let's be right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:27] This was a style that existed. It wasn't just for J. Crew. So you can find on, like, third-party sites, a bunch of different colors. So I got a bunch of different colors, and I just wear basically that style with different color swooshes.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:43] Always white, but with a different color swoosh.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:45] Yes. What are they?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:46] Because they're not flights or whatever they are.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:48] They're kill-shot twos.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:50] Kill shot twos. Interesting. So now you've put that out there, everybody's going to buy those out. They'll be able to get them again.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:56] Well, they already do. When I wear these blue ones, these are my like they're kind of messed up already, so they're my everyday shoes. But if I'm trying to look nicer, I wear the other colors. But these, like, I'll wear them to a restaurant or an office or whatever. Guaranteed, if there's more than, like, 50 people there, another guy will have them on because they were super popular at J. Crew, and everyone has them.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [44:18] Oh, interesting. Yeah, I did not buy them. I really liked when they did, like, the Vans Authentic J. Crew run. That was pretty cool. Then they started, like, selling well, they sell all kinds of random stuff now, but they had these Adidas Terrex-like hikers. They look basically like the dad shoes that Kanye made popular, but not Ye branded. So I did that for a bit. Those are very cushy and comfortable, too. But I feel like no shoes seem to last that long anymore.

**Robbie Wagner:** [44:45] Yeah. And the problem with Nikes is they're all, like, super limited run. If you don't buy two pairs, when you buy them and you decide you like them three months later, there's no way you're ever getting those shoes again. So that's kind of frustrating. So that's why I just found on the third markets. Here's, these I forget where I bought them from, but I could find them elsewhere.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:06] Stockx or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:08] I don't know. I can probably find it real quick.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:10] Let's see some places. Going to have it more consistently, but yeah, isn't that strange and interesting? Like, if there's just a basic pair of Nikes that you like, why can't they just make them forever? Why do they have to create this exclusivity? I just want to have this shoe all the time, and I don't want to have to stock up ten pairs of them.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:28] Yeah. There's just such a robust market for people to buy them and trade them and stuff. I think that they want it to be kind of exclusive.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:36] Yeah. Which is weird, right? Like, they've created that limited run of something that's a consumable to a degree. So it's also kind of a pain in the ass.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:47] I got it from Stadium Goods is where I bought from.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:50] Okay. Never heard of that, but that's okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:52] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:52] I, every once in a while, get, like, a hair up my butt about a particular sneaker or something that I want to find, and we'll start to look for some things. Or I'll remember something I had in high school and like, oh, I want that again. Because they are remaking everything, so you can usually find it somewhere.

**Robbie Wagner:** [46:06] Well, now, I wouldn't wear them, but the most unique shoes that I ever had were Puma used to let you customize shoes. I don't know if you ever saw that. So you could pick each piece?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [46:17] No, but Adidas did that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [46:18] Could be a different material. And I got, like, purple crocodile leather for around the laces and then, like, fur lined inside, like, pink bottom, like, basically just clown shoes. But they were, like, so cool because I could change everything. And then I don't know why places don't do more of that to where you can just make it exactly how you want.

**Robbie Wagner:** [46:39] The Nike ones are, like.

**Chuck Carpenter:**[46:40] Probably a logistical nightmare.

**Robbie Wagner:** [46:42] You can change, like, a color or two, but they don't let you fully say, I want this to be a totally different material that you don't offer. In this shoe, it's, like, every material they had. I think they called it, like, the Mongolian Shoe barbecue. And you could pick all of your stuff like a Mongolian barbecue.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [46:59] You can see where that didn't last long, right? I mean, come on. They're a German shoe company.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:03] Well, I had fun with it. It was, like, senior year of high school, so it's been a bit.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:09] Yeah. That's the time to, as they say, peacock a little more. Yeah, you don't care as much. Whatever. Right now, you probably just, like, just got to find a white pair of shoes and just wear those forever. That's the problem.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:20] Yeah, I found the pants that I want to wear all the time, so. That's solved.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:25] What'd you settle on?

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:25] They're Mugsies.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:27] Mugsies?

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:28] Have you seen those?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:29] I don't think so.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:30] They're like stretchy jeans.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:31] Oh, you have showed me these before. I don't know. I had mixed feelings on that. I don't know how much time you spend solving this problem constantly in your life, but it never ends for sure. I'm certain of that. Because you find it, and you're like, I'm good. I'm happy with this for a little bit. And then, like, four months later, it's changed because you found something else.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:50] Well, the problem is, four months later, I'm 10 pounds heavier, so I have to change to something else.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:57] Yeah, we'll do a whatnot where we talk about ways to stop that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:02] Okay.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:04] But anyways, just eat potatoes, remember?

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:07] Oh, I know. So have you seen the show The Woman in the House Across the Street from the girl in the window?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:14] I have seen the title, and it made me tired, and after I finished reading the title, it was time for bed. Yeah, I haven't gotten to that yet.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:23] So, yes, the title is funny like that on purpose. So it's a comedy, and it's very good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** 48:30] What's it on? Where can I find it?

**Robbie Wagner:**[48:32] It's on Netflix, and they're only, like, 26 minutes per episode, and there's only eight, so you can, like, we finished six of them the first time we sat down to watch it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:41] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:41] So we only have two left, but it's super good. It's like, this lady lives in this house. If you watch the preview, I'm not giving away any spoilers in the preview. It shows like, she lives in this house, right, and she drinks a ton of wine. She has some mental stuff going on. She's taking some pills and things. And you hear her talk to her therapist on the phone, and he's like, yeah, you're not taking those with alcohol, are you? And she's like, no, I've been cutting back. And she has, like, this glass of wine that's filled to the top, like no room in the glass.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:12] Nice.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:13] It's good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:13] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:14] I would recommend watching it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:15] Well, that's a good segue into, so I've been watching Shrinking on Apple TV. Oh, yeah. With Jason Siegel and Harrison Ford.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:23] Yeah, I've heard that's good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:24] It is good. And it's funny. I mean, it's a little more serious than I thought it was going to be. Like, there's those sad kind of serious undertones, but overall, it's very entertaining, very funny. And then also been watching Last of US.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:37] Oh, yeah. I haven't started that yet, either.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:39] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:39] I was torn between, like, should I play the game and then watch it?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:44] Right. Or do you have a PlayStation? I don't have one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:47] Is it PlayStation only?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:48] I think it is. Exclusive. Exclusive.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:52] We do I forget which PlayStation we have. What's the new one?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:57] Five.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:57] That everyone can't get.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:59] Five is the new one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:00] Okay. Then I think we have a four.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:02] Yeah. And I don't think it's a new game. I think there's a part two, but I think the game it's based on is like a three or four-game.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:10] Yeah. Because what I'm worried about is I'll watch the show, and it'll be really good, and then I'll go, hey, I should play this game, but most of the plot of the game will be gone. And that's the point of the game, is it's not necessarily that hard to play. It's just like playing a movie.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:24] Right. I'm not sure I'm a fee expert on that. We should have Rob on. Just ask him that question and then kick him off.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:34] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:35] Good to know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:35] We'll phone a friend.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:37] Well, as we often get frequent comments and feedback on Twitter about the show. If you're listening to this and you happen to know more details on that particular item, feel free to let us know. It'll take us two, three weeks to Google and get the information, so it'd be great to just have direct feedback or, I'm sorry, chat GPT could just tell us.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:58] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:59] No, so, yeah, I have not. I will check that show. I also recommend my shows to you because what else are you going to do mostly?

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:09] Well, I've been playing a lot of Hogwarts Legacy, as has Katelynn, so been busy with that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:17] Yeah, been entertained with that. That's good.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:20] Well, since I have an hour or two of potential free time a day, I usually use it for that. So I haven't had time for shows really.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:28] That's fair. Yeah, I mean, I hear it's pretty good, and maybe I'll get around to it at some point. I just was never that into that whole world or whatever. But was it two months? We get the new Zelda, and that is going to be a different thing. I have thought about going back to Breath of the Wild, too. Like, oh, I've got a couple of months. Maybe I should play that again and just kind of get up to speed on the gameplay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:52] Yeah, I started it like, I don't know, I remember when within the last six months some time I started it again and played it for, like, maybe a week. And then, I don't know, something I got busy, and then if I get busy and stop playing a game, it's hard for me to get back into it. Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:11] And also, like you said, you don't have a lot of free time, so play multiple games at once. You've kind of made your decision.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:18] Yeah. So definitely going to play the new one and going to play Diablo Four when it comes out. I think Zelda is May, and Diablo is June, I believe.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:30] I'll take your word for it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:31] I'll be busy not doing any work for a couple of months.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:34] Your summer vacation is not working. Sorry.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:39] Yeah. I'll just use all my PTO then, and we'll figure it out at Christmas time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:44] Yeah. Who needs to travel overrated?

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:47] Yeah. All right, well, we're about at time. Just a quick plug for anyone who hasn't noticed yet.
