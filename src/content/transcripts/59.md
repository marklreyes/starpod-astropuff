[00:00:00] What's up everyone? My name is Mark and those two over there, that's Darrell and Mike, two of my like-minded friends who I roped into having adult conversations powered by cannabis. Were simply three dads, husbands, and full-time desktop athletes striving to figure out how recreational cannabis plugs into our modern day world.

Why do vape pens look like USB drives? Should I smoke it or eat it? What would my kids think? We're problem solving our way through this type of mentality on a daily basis, and we decided to capture it in audio. For those of you pondering the same things, but be warned, we speculate a ton and get stuck in God's fridge quite a bit.

You can blame that on the munchies. So if you're comfy with that, come on in, pull up a chair and kick back and welcome to the Puff Provisions podcast.

**Darrell:** [00:01:00] Hey everyone

**Mark:** and welcome to a brand new episode of the Puff Provisions Podcast. I am one of three of your reMarkable hosts at Puff Provision Mark Puff Mark, I got a little bit of cotton mouth and I don't even have anything going on inside of my body yet. Cheers to that and to my right is at Puff

**Mark:** Mike And is Bret the Hitman Hart Glasses? What's up Mike? How you doing?

**Mike:** A little tired,

**Mark:** Respect to that. We good? We good. And to my bottom, into my screen. In my world, that's at Puff Darrell, who not too long ago, just took a quick hi, quick puff, just so he gave it.

**Darrell:** yeah, I don't know what, I just grabbed some and tossed it in the canister. I don't know what we're gonna get. It might be like a indica sativa.

**Mark:** what you did. What do you wait. Slow down, sailor. What are you doing here?

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** Puff responsibly.

**Darrell:** I have a vape, so I have a

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** vape,

**Mark:** [00:02:00] Okay.

**Darrell:** I just, I don't wash like the container that I put all my nugs in.

**Darrell:** So it's

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** the bottom, there's like a mix

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** different strains in there and I

**Darrell:** Grabbed a quick pinch, and then threw in the canister and heated it up. So

**Mark:** did you even give it a little bit of a blessing? Come on.

**Darrell:** don't know. I don't know.

**Mark:** Okay,

**Darrell:** sativa. I might want to paint the house.

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** It's,

**Darrell:** nap. I don't know.

**Mark:** this conversation's about to get really heavy because I'm about to do this in real time. A nice little gif Mike gave me back during the holiday season. I'm on my last piece, by the way,

**Mike:** Oh,

**Mark:** Smokey's edibles, cannabis infused live resin fruit chew mango sativa uplift, whatever that means.

**Mark:** But

**Mark:** That looks like a,

**Darrell:** Mike, I

**Mark:** that's a great experience.

**Mike:** Oh, you just did.

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** So here we go. What did Morpheus say? You get the red pill or the blue pill, right?

**Darrell:** or the blue

**Mark:** Then we got the kind of orangey mango pill. So cheers to you because [00:03:00] tonight, I don't wanna chew all a samari on this microphone, but I'm gonna do it anyway. It's time to give flowers, pay respects, if you will.

**Mark:** It's time for the Mount Rushmore of Canada. A very bias, controversial, fun topic could go either way. You could put the atypical top 40 stars that, in the last couple decades alone, could be somebody new that I had no freaking clue about. But tonight is a very personable, personal opinion on who deserves to be on your influence of Mount Rushmore of Canada.

**Mark:** Now I know that all three of us come from different backgrounds in regards to our relationship with cannabis. Mike, you pretty much started going head first into it when legalization happened, right?

**Mike:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Mark:** you're somewhere in between where you're an off and on kind of person, dabbled here and there, but never really went too far down the rabbit hole.

**Mark:** But [00:04:00] you were here and there, and as I went all in for a long period of time. So we've got three different types of spectrums of like use. Views and then some. And tonight I was really itching at the fact that, whatever you pinged me earlier today, Dee, about Snoop's most recent YouTube video, his recent music video, his last, what's it called?

**Mark:** The Last Thing of Mary Jane. Like my,

**Darrell:** the, yeah, that is an amazing music video.

**Mark:** you know what? I didn't even know. I didn't even know Tom Petty was dead. I had to Google it

**Darrell:** No.

**Mark:** and verify in Wikipedia that he was dead. I was like, that's cool. He's doing something.

**Darrell:** Yeah. Didn't he die? What? Like only a couple years ago. Just

**Mark:** No. 2017 he died. He died like eight years ago. I didn't even know. And I'm like, I remember that guy. I saw him like in a couple MTV videos back in like the early nineties or whatever.

**Mark:** But,

**Darrell:** You

**Mark:** and I know some of his music, but I didn't think it, I didn't think he died. And then that big guy, what's his name? Who's the big guy?

**Darrell:** Jelly

**Mark:** you. See, that's a little new to me. I [00:05:00] know he's a popular artist out there, but I don't know. Hi. I don't know his work. I really don't know.

**Darrell:** he's like the

**Mark:** He's,

**Darrell:** years.

**Mark:** but he's rap and country, that's the thing.

**Mark:** Like he did rap and then he started doing country lately. That's what I know of him, and I've only glossed over this.

**Darrell:** I feel, you know what? I just. Tangent here regarding that, like you, you mentioned like rap country. I think it's been done before. I've heard it in other, almost wanna say was it like Bubba Sparks like one of those guys,

**Mark:** He was, he came from that kind of background like, but it's Southern, it's So his stuff was southern hip hop.

**Mike:** was

**Darrell:** it

**Mark:** Yeah, it was southern hip hop.

**Mark:** Not true country. Yeah. But the influences, the country were definitely there from southern hip hop.

**Darrell:** the, it's a, I like the sound of it though. It's,

**Mark:** I think if anything, who did a crossover? Snoop did a crossover, but it was more of like adjacent. He went from hip hop to reggae a little bit, and then he came back to hip hop.

**Mike:** They

**Mark:** That's right. Snoop Line

**Darrell:** It was [00:06:00] Rastafari, snoop. That was actually a good album.

**Mark:** was it?

**Darrell:** it didn't get rated, but I really liked it.

**Mark:** I I didn't actually I haven't even pressed play on that album.

**Mike:** it.

**Mark:** Me neither. I don't think, I don't even think I streamed it. I only stream as classics, as old stuff, any gin and juice

**Mike:** listen

**Mark:** And then some,

**Mike:** It's included in your Spotify subscription.

**Mark:** It is, but like, whenever, like the algorithms tell me like they, they're watching what I pick and they're like, okay, let me make a remix for you. So this is what you like. And I'm like, yeah, this is what I like, so hat tipped to Spotify, 'cause I haven't turned them off yet. They've definitely deprecated my Pandora ways.

**Mark:** I'm not on Pandora anymore. They really stole the show at that one. Sorry about that. I. I think I dated myself yet again by saying Pandora, but whatevs? Yeah, I know

**Mike:** Old, old guy

**Mark:** Hey, but do you guys pay for Spotify?

**Mike:** Apple Music.

**Darrell:** I have

**Mark:** Oh, you pay for Apple Music, but so you pay for it. [00:07:00] What other, what? What other music subscriptions do you pay for?

**Darrell:** That's the only one I have

**Mark:** Okay, so do you recommend it?

**Darrell:** Yeah, it's,

**Mark:** That's a, that is not good.

**Darrell:** So I've done both. I've done Spotify and I've done Apple Music. I switched over from Spot from Apple Music or from Spotify to Apple Music. The only reason why I have Apple Music is because of the family plan.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** this

**Darrell:** One. Fee flat. That's it. Which is nice. Like it works for college kids and what have you.

**Darrell:** But like the family sharing like feature of

**Mark:** Excuse me.

**Darrell:** is what I was after.

**Mark:** How much is it at the time of this recording?

**Darrell:** It's a

**Mark:** Oh, it's just a feature. Okay.

**Mike:** Are you talking about spot apple Music itself? How much is Apple

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mike:** that feature?

**Mark:** One. 'cause I'm trying to get an understanding. Okay. It's included

**Mike:** in the

**Mark:** in the family plan. In the subscription

**Mike:** music costs.

**Darrell:** It's 17 [00:08:00] bucks

**Mark:** per month or a year.

**Darrell:** a month.

**Mark:** You pay $17 a month for music. I can get on YouTube for free. What the hell? Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

**Darrell:** I want audio file and it has to be good. Sound like I'm not, it's garbled.

**Mark:** Know what? I need to bring you back to your Napster days because this isn't working. This is not a good idea.

**Darrell:** only get five songs out of Napster.

**Mark:** 192 kilobytes per second wasn't that the thing?

**Darrell:** I don't even know what that was. I just

**Mark:** Neither. I just chose the number. You think it's right. That's right.

**Darrell:** number.

**Mark:** Tonight, gentlemen, we're gonna go for the as high of a number as we can because you're an artist, you are being empowered to section off a piece of granite. We're gonna have granite in Yosemite. I know the real Mount Rush Rushmore's in South Dakota, but that piece of real estate's already taken, so we're not gonna go there.

**Mark:** We're [00:09:00] gonna carve out a new piece of granite in, yosemite. Yeah. You know what we're gonna impose ourselves. We got the approvals from the state. I don't know, but we're gonna go to Yosemite.

**Darrell:** I don't think they're mountains over there. Oh no, there's

**Mark:** They got mountains. You can hike there

**Darrell:** that.

**Mark:** people.

**Darrell:** I'm getting my.

**Mark:** Okay. You know what? How about this? Let's keep it local.

**Mark:** Then we got,

**Darrell:** Yellowstone. I think he's

**Mark:** Oh, it is? Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking Yellowstone. See, I'm so ignorant. I don't deal with forests and trees and shit like that. I deal with the suburbs.

**Darrell:** He like knew the answer before you knew it. He was like, information over watching you drown.

**Mark:** know. Really? It's like shit. Okay. So I failed geography. I get it. I get it.

**Darrell:** now.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** I, it just sounds right.

**Mark:** okay, so now then we'll scope it down to the city county of San Diego. We'll just

**Mike:** sure.

**Mark:** we'll go to the let's go to Mount Soledad in in La Jolla. Just say we got, that's a, let's just say we got approval there.

**Mark:** We're gonna carve out a little something, since there is no granite there, but they're gonna have to put some granite [00:10:00] there. And we're just gonna stick it at the very top of Soledad time to put four faces on there. And we're gonna do them one at a time. And we have to come into agreement on the four faces.

**Mark:** It can't be, it can't be 12 different faces from three different opinions. Three times four equals 12.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** We're gonna have to, we. How many faces are on the real Mount Rushmore? Dude, come on.

**Darrell:** No, but no.

**Mike:** I could fill four,

**Darrell:** what

**Mark:** That's fun.

**Mark:** What template are we falling?

**Darrell:** what if there's only three? Or what if we have five? Which mountain are we destroying?

**Mark:** Okay, let's let's put,

**Mike:** They're gonna be big as big a heads for

**Darrell:** Which.

**Mark:** we're a destroying mount Soledad, that's for sure. We're totally, we're effect,

**Darrell:** Dude,

**Mark:** we're effectively wrecking it.

**Mark:** We are gonna clear out

**Darrell:** no. If it was on Mount Soledad, you know how big would have to be. It was probably gonna be like three feet by six feet. Mount Soledad is so small.

**Mark:** And your point is we [00:11:00] are proud. We are proud to idolize and immortalize our people. Yeah. Yeah. We just do it.

**Darrell:** That's what I was just saying. It's to scale.

**Mark:** Look, the edible hasn't kicked in yet, so probably by the third or the fourth face it's gonna kick in. So I'm pretty composed and measured right about now. So we're gonna give our flowers and, pay our respects to these these people out there.

**Mark:** Man, woman or child? No, not child. No. You don't put children up there. To put. On here. So let's just put it, let's put it in perspective, right? We know the real Mount Rushmore has four faces for the founding fathers of the United States, right? We got who?

**Mike:** Yeah,

**Mark:** We got Jefferson got Roosevelt, and you got Lincoln.

**Mike:** Lincoln

**Mark:** Okay, so the fourth one's gonna be the fourth one's gonna be,

**Mike:** Darl.

**Mark:** so I failed geography. You failed US history. Now we just gotta find out through this conversation where Mike failed. Ah, man. You know why to think, people need to [00:12:00] bend the knee because we did it in a pre-internet world. Okay? We didn't have iPhones in our pockets. We had TI 83 calculators for math tops.

**Mark:** That's all we had, but we didn't have anything else. You actually had a think about it a little bit, but at any rate, I'm actually gonna put the spot on you, First D, since you don't know your US history, who would you put. Your Mount Rushmore of cannabis first face

**Darrell:** first face Wolf,

**Mark:** man or woman, and obviously why

**Darrell:** it's gonna. B ha.

**Mark:** disagree. I can disagree.

**Darrell:** is the, this is on George Washington's spot, right? It would be

**Mark:** Yes. We're gonna go from left to right and with the final one being Lincoln.

**Darrell:** So it's gonna be my, the first one's gonna be Bob Marley.

**Mark:** Oh, why?

**Darrell:** He, he's like the he's the face of it. He's the face of it all. When

**Mark:** I could art.

**Darrell:** when you think weed you, [00:13:00] first thing that pops into my mind is Bob Marley,

**Mark:** That is true. The music speaks for itself in terms of love and everything like that. But there's definitely intonations and tones, especially from, I. His reggae culture and all of that. And if you read in between the,

**Darrell:** for me, even e even that it's like the minute, like I, it's an association. It's literally weed. Bob Marley.

**Mark:** that's true. You can't escape it either, and it's not even, it's not even conveyed in a negative way.

**Darrell:** though, right? I guess if you're younger, you'd be like, weed, Seth Rogan depending on when you came up.

**Darrell:** But for me, when I think weed, I think Bob Marley, it's,

**Mark:** Seth Rogan gets honorable mention, but I wouldn't put him as definitely one of the people that founded the country of cannabis. You know what I mean?

**Mark:** He gets a, he definitely gets a special mention, but I wouldn't put him on granite for this one. I. Mike, you got anything to add to that or objections to that?

**Mark:** I like it. I like it as the [00:14:00] first face,

**Darrell:** that's a strong foot forward, just Bob Marley.

**Mike:** And just for me personally, listening to his music specifically while while lit is pretty cool, it's pretty cool.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** The thing.

**Mark:** You ever noticed all of his music, all of his music, any track that you've ever played, it instantly hits you in a calm way.

**Mark:** There is no anger that comes out of the fiber of your body. It's just 100% chill. And you already know that. It's like it's gonna be all right?

**Mark:** Every little thing's gonna be all right.

**Mike:** so I can listen right now.

**Mark:** Exactly right.

**Mike:** it's

**Mark:** bad. I don't think I, I don't think I have enough licensing to put him in the background for that long, but,

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** hat tip to that. But I will agree. Are we in agreement to that? I think that was a pretty easy one. I can't argue that.

**Darrell:** an easy one, right? That's slow hanging fruit.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** hanging fruit.

**Mark:** Methyl hanging fruit, but well deserved [00:15:00] because he is an icon and his music transcends even to this day, the year's 2025, you're talking about. At least three to four generations worth, or three to four decades worth of of influence, excuse me, not generations, but three to four decades worth of in a powerful, consistent influence.

**Mark:** Doesn't matter what color your skin tone or what part of the country you're from, when you listen to it or you hear it, it downplays you right away. And you're in that show mode,

**Darrell:** again, it's the, it is the association. I think it, you also see it as and here's another reason why I would think that. What's your gen, like when you stereotype a person who smokes weed? Who do you picture?

**Mark:** But the way you say stereotype sounds really negative. Like I don't want a stereotype. What do you mean?

**Darrell:** Just an example. There's movies like, where he smo it's some guy smoking weed. And then how's he portrayed? Oh, he had braids, he got beanie,

**Darrell:** He's listening to Bob Marley in the background.

**Darrell:** That's usually, that's like how they've stereotyped.

**Darrell:** Typed it as [00:16:00] well, that's what I'm just trying to say.

**Mark:** Ah, okay. Yeah, I get you.

**Darrell:** Bob Marley has.

**Mark:** That's true.

**Darrell:** to the stereotype level.

**Mark:** That's true. Yeah. I, okay. That resets my perspective. I get you. All right. That was easy. Low hanging fruit. We're moving on to the next head. After Washington was this guy named Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. Actually, quite a controversial figure.

**Mark:** Re known slave owner, just to be sure, I think Washington, they were all slave owners at that time, in that era of time. But we're not going there. We're not going there. But Thomas Jefferson was a con.

**Darrell:** from you right now, Mark.

**Mark:** Thomas Jefferson was a very controversial figure. So I wanna see which controversial yet well-respected cannabis face we could put on here next.

**Mark:** This, not, this one should not be low hanging fruit, so you can't say this or that. And this is easy. Give me someone with a little bit more spice to be next to Mr. Marley at [00:17:00] Puff Mike, you got one in your head off the top of your head, and this edible starting to kick in just a tiny bit. 17 minutes into this podcast, it's coming.

**Mike:** I

**Mark:** I made it too hard by saying it has to be controversial. Let me pull that out if it can't.

**Mike:** people that smoke weed, and two of them are you,

**Mark:** I don't count, I can't be put on that. I'm simply a squirrel trying to get a nut in this thing. I'm not an icon like those people. Okay. If I were to say, if I were to say Willie Nelson, would you, do would you strongly disagree, mildly disagree, indifferent. He's a no on there.

**Darrell:** Wholeheartedly.

**Mark:** We pull. We don't even put him on there.

**Mark:** We don't even put him on there. Is it?

**Mike:** think he should be off, Darrell?

**Darrell:** no, I think he should be on there. [00:18:00] He's

**Mark:** Oh. Oh, okay.

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** You made it sound like he shouldn't

**Darrell:** I agree with you.

**Mark:** I feel like outside of, rock and roll and his influence in the seventies and things like that, Mike's saying no. He just. I look at 'em and I feel like that blood is green. I feel like that blood is all green, like it's right there.

**Darrell:** big advocate for that though.

**Mark:** Oh, for sure.

**Mark:** To be fair, all of these people that we suggest in some way, shape, or form advocate.

**Darrell:** it. Yeah.

**Mark:** In some way, shape or form, they advocate.

**Darrell:** like with Bob Marley, like I don't think he advertised that he smoked weed. It was just seen around him and him consuming it. He didn't have

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** he consumed weed.

**Mark:** He never Yeah, that's true.

**Darrell:** Like only like just recently, like within the past, what? 20 years He came forward as a weed smoker. think there was a

**Mark:** Really?

**Darrell:** know him as a weed smoker.

**Mark:** Oh, I knew him as a weed smoker. The moment I saw was it

**Darrell:** half

**Darrell:** So like

**Mark:** half [00:19:00] baked with Dave Chappelle. Yeah. Late nineties. I. I knew who Willie Nelson was, but I didn't know he was like into Potter or anything like that until I saw that movie.

**Darrell:** yeah, so that's from, that's what I was thinking like,

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** but

**Mark:** But the thing is I speak outta ignorance too. 'cause it's I don't know his music. I know of him as a celebrity and as an influence. I've never really listened to any of his songs.

**Darrell:** I think we know a couple of his songs because it's been sampled.

**Mark:** By way of a jingle then, so I don't know.

**Darrell:** We've probably heard it, that I'm sure he's not, he's fair. His music's fairly popular.

**Mark:** Okay. Mike is I don't know about this. He's

**Mike:** to me his celebrity and reach I

**Mike:** I know that he

**Mark:** look at the way he's skinning this. Look at the way he's skinning this.

**Mike:** A huge advocate and whatnot, but his celebrity doesn't influence or reach far

**Mark:** I see what you're saying.

**Mike:** Rushmore.

**Mark:** It doesn't transcend as it should.

**Mike:** doesn't.

**Mark:** [00:20:00] Okay.

**Mike:** first of all, we're older and we don't really, you couldn't name me.

**Mike:** I couldn't name you. You I would assume none of you guys right off the top of your head, could come up with a Willie Nelson song. Or even the tune of it.

**Mark:** No. I couldn't, I.

**Mike:** of it. I couldn't even, yes. Maybe if I heard it. Okay,

**Mark:** And then I could recognize it. Yeah. But like off the top of my head,

**Mike:** yeah, exactly. And if you told me, Hey, which one is it?

**Mike:** Willie Nelson song, then yeah. But I think the Mount Rushmore has to be of, this is a three by six head. This is,

**Mark:** we paid for this. That's right. We paid for this. That's right.

**Mike:** saying. They gotta be worthy of that. And to limit it to four, I think there's maybe at least another musician.

**Mark:** I I got a lock it to four in honor of the original Mount Rushmore.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** We're not deviating.

**Mike:** I honestly think maybe Snoop should be

**Mark:** Oh,

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** As opposed to Willie Nelson

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** weren't they tied together too? At one point

**Darrell:** They called, they, I remember they did like a collab.

**Mark:** They did a collab. That's right. They did. But,

**Darrell:** a [00:21:00] collab.

**Mark:** And I could agree to that because Snoop transcends generations and he has pop influence, like popular influence.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** for crying out loud, the guy hosted the Olympics back in Paris most recently.

**Mike:** And he is, he still advocates weed.

**Mark:** yeah. In so many different ways.

**Mike:** and

**Mark:** Yep.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** I could certainly agree to that

**Mike:** Far reaching influence.

**Mark:** And he meets my he meets my quota of being controversial because we know, he's, as a rapper, you don't have a smooth history,

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** He's had speed bumps along the way with death row records, his own personal hiccups and gotchas along the way, transitioning out into no limit and coming full circle, buying death row records.

**Mark:** He was accused for murder. And that's listed, that's peppered all over his lyrics. I think in. His mid nineties albums. So yeah, so it's it's totally out there. It's on the fly and he, the dude, the guy cross cut and collabed with Martha Stewart, and they're like the best of friends now.

**Mark:** It's it doesn't get any more [00:22:00] opposite than Martha Stewart. And she's like a big lifestyle influencer. Like one of the OG influencers before the word influencer became a term and they're like, this dude, what's up?

**Darrell:** think Martha Stewart, like also like a weed consumer also?

**Mark:** I'll give her flowers, but she doesn't get to be put on on, on Mount Rushmore.

**Mike:** think

**Mark:** She's not consistent. Yeah,

**Mike:** only, she benefited from the the partnership as

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** I agree. I agree to that.

**Mike:** phased out and then

**Mike:** oh, now it's cool to like Martha Stewart,

**Mark:** yep. Yep. I think she started getting phased out when she had that insider trading thing happen and she shut down for a couple years.

**Mike:** brought her totally back,

**Mark:** yep. I agree to that. But, she can get her flowers too. But again, we're trying to put,

**Mike:** As far as

**Mark:** we're trying to put people on the, we're trying to put people on granite here and immortalize 'em forever.

**Mark:** So we got Bob Marley. I can agree to Snoop. So he's turned in a little bit looking out in that other direction. Wow. Bob [00:23:00] Marley's looking out in the total horizon. Face number three in our founding fathers belongs to, I forget which Roosevelt it was. I don't know if it's, is it Teddy Roosevelt?

**Mark:** No, it's Teddy. It's not Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Eleanor's the wife. Dude.

**Darrell:** Yeah, the

**Mark:** The wives the wives get credit after the fact.

**Mike:** Roosevelt

**Mark:** unfortunately. Google that for me. It's not. F-D-R-F-D-R was World War II era. Had have been Teddy Roosevelt. It's Theodore Roosevelt.

**Darrell:** Teddy

**Mark:** But was, what was Theodore Roosevelt good for?

**Mark:** What was he a, what was he a I get why he's a president, but what was so novel about him? 'cause that's the parameter I'm gonna match against for this cannabis suggestion.

**Mike:** Roosevelt provided leadership when America experienced rapid economic growth as it entered the 28th. 20th century. He

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** negotiating the construction of the Panama Canal. Ensure the

**Mark:** Okay. Okay. So this is,

**Mike:** [00:24:00] monopolies. Oh, so he brought,

**Mark:** so he,

**Mike:** wealth to America

**Mark:** okay, I get it. Yeah. The development of the Panama Canal. So this is the era of World War I or pre-World War I.

**Mike:** Pre,

**Mark:** at pre

**Mike:** died in

**Mark:** so late

**Mike:** So that's

**Mark:** World War I was in the 19 hundreds. Okay. So late 18 hundreds into the early 19 hundreds World War I era, bringing the establishment of wealth.

**Mark:** Through Monopoly and bigger trade, like the Panama Canal in service. Okay, I get it. All right, so then we're gonna try to look for someone that is of that magnitude in, in position number three as a head who they all transcend that we can't use that word anymore because all of these figures must transcend a certain way to get there.

**Mark:** So we got first, as a founding father encompassing the whole thing that lays the land. That's Marley one, that's slightly a controversial figure. Yet still transcends. That's two. That's Snoop who deserves to be number three in the world of [00:25:00] Canada.

**Darrell:** For my person, for my

**Mark:** Yes.

**Mark:** Yes, sir. I want it. I want your personal opinion.

**Darrell:** thought Willie Nelson could be on there since he's not. Number two, is he a

**Mark:** How do you.

**Darrell:** three?

**Mark:** What justifies him for three?

**Darrell:** I don't know. Just his association to it. Everyone knows him as a, celebrity advocate, cel celebrity advocate for weed?

**Darrell:** I don't know. It depends. I guess it's not really a popularity contest, right?

**Mark:** It is because these are, you don't, the unpopular presidents didn't get put on granite. It's the ones that,

**Mike:** scientists on

**Mark:** we're not putting scientists, so it's like we. This is totally spit balling based off of what we know. Yeah. So I get where you're coming from.

**Darrell:** Politicians, we could, don't know.

**Mike:** You know what, we would put a president on there. If the first president that makes weed federally legal, that

**Mark:** I would then that president can go on [00:26:00] there, the first president that makes it.

**Darrell:** Bill Clinton.

**Mark:** He was in denial of inhaling, and he never have,

**Darrell:** That's

**Mark:** he didn't have sex with that woman. And we all know what happened in those two terms. Okay? All right. We all know Billy got a little got a little freaky out there,

**Darrell:** I was there,

**Mark:** You want Willie Nelson or Willie Clinton on there?

**Mark:** Who do you want?

**Darrell:** So I'm torn, so I

**Mike:** Willie Clinton.

**Mark:** Yeah. Oh, that was a nice little quick setup. These edibles are kicking in, buddy.

**Darrell:** Willie Clinton. I was

**Mark:** You're torn.

**Darrell:** I was talking 'cause I was thinking Willie Nelson or, and I just, another one is we, can we do two for the number three spot? Can we a

**Mark:** You mean two heads, Tom. Okay. She.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** Tommy

**Mark:** Chong, Chechen Chong. So basically the old comedies from back in the Day that didn't infer it, totally implied Stoner, and they were part of [00:27:00] influencing pop culture,

**Darrell:** do it, right?

**Mark:** Like openly and blatantly. It's on record if you watch their movies.

**Darrell:** of the plot of the movie. Like it

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** the main

**Mark:** There would always be the special effect was basically hot boxing their car basically, or hot boxing a room and smoke would come out of it.

**Mark:** They'd clear the cobwebs and shit what happened.

**Mike:** And

**Mark:** I could agree to that. They're alive.

**Mike:** Yeah, they're alive and active in the community

**Darrell:** Yeah. They

**Mike:** Think

**Darrell:** they're still acting. And then they also have their own they all have, they have their own flour. They

**Mark:** Oh, they have their own brand. Cannabis brand. We could leave it at that. Yeah.

**Darrell:** that's something that the other two didn't do.

**Mark:** Yes, and they did make, they did openly make these comedies for your consumption,

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** at risk in a world where they could have basically been locked up forever.

**Mike:** To be fair, to be honest,

**Mark:** Uhhuh,

**Mike:** I've never watched a Teach and Chong film.

**Darrell:** Oh, you've

**Mark:** if you've watched, you just need to [00:28:00] watch one because they're all, it is the same formula over and over.

**Darrell:** one is good.

**Mark:** And honestly the, let's be honest, the acting isn't that good. It's like from the eighties and the seventies and shit like that, but it's just funny.

**Darrell:** it's funny. It is. That's

**Mark:** Yeah. It's just stoner.

**Darrell:** Mike in, in that timeframe. 'cause some of those jokes today would not fly.

**Mark:** You mean they have an aged well kind of mentality

**Darrell:** an

**Mark:** or they're just not funny? Oh, yeah.

**Darrell:** like offended over Over here,

**Mike:** saying the F

**Darrell:** dude. It's they play on everything, man.

**Mark:** They play on, everything's from, they play on, gay quite heavily. Like they, they tease that spectrum quite a bit.

**Darrell:** it, if you're

**Mark:** Yeah. It's not acceptable in the modern day sense,

**Darrell:** gonna hit it outta the park because of the

**Darrell:** In the se in the eighties with that

**Mark:** yeah. I think.

**Mike:** of the time.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** perfectly honest, though, every comedian pushed the envelope and teased the teased those types of subcultures.

**Mark:** None of those comedians in that era, in the seventies, eighties, even perhaps even the nineties could survive their [00:29:00] bit. In today's world, it'd be inappropriate.

**Darrell:** also during that time, they were able to it up.

**Mark:** Yes. And that's why I wanted to get back on, like it was risky.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** they did it out in the open and they never lied about what they did thematically about any of their knees.

**Darrell:** yeah, and it

**Darrell:** Like they actually. They

**Darrell:** They lived the part,

**Mark:** I think if you Google it, one of 'em got arrested for a little bit of time because of this.

**Darrell:** Tommy.

**Mark:** forget Tommy got locked up for a little bit of time.

**Darrell:** a little bit. Yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah. So you know that guy just, he paid his dues more times over. And but they still never changed their formula. They still made movies after the fact or still

**Mark:** Stayed true to their character.

**Darrell:** I met him. met

**Mark:** Oh, yeah. At the marching ash opening.

**Darrell:** Yeah. It wasn't an opening, it was more like he's like a fan. No, it was like a fan meet. It was like sometime in July, dude. He was so big.

**Mark:** Why wouldn't you [00:30:00] be?

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** I would.

**Darrell:** he signed all the autographs by hand, one by one.

**Darrell:** There are at least like 200 people there.

**Mark:** Oh shit.

**Darrell:** And.

**Mark:** He was functional though.

**Darrell:** dude, you could, yeah, he was, but it was like automatic, sign here, and

**Darrell:** Said, oh, what's up, dude? Like that or something, right? And then I.

**Mark:** you get a chance to talk to him?

**Darrell:** I just I just said, hello, hi. And he's

**Mike:** Thank you.

**Darrell:** I said, I said, I was like, what's up Tommy?

**Darrell:** And then I said, and I, and yeah, hi.

**Mark:** I think I remember

**Darrell:** what's up, bro? It was,

**Mark:** this was the March and Ash grand opening or something like that. Or like their little promo event

**Darrell:** one of those.

**Mark:** At their Chula Vista location.

**Darrell:** yeah, but

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** That was pretty cool. Like

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** yeah.

**Mark:** And just in all fairness, I would put it in order like Chi Chan Chong, like a totem pole poll. So you could just read it like that, so we got Marley.

**Darrell:** on one stone

**Mark:** we'll do a, we'll do like a totem pole. One head stacked on top of the other, [00:31:00] because I don't want it from left to looking there's five heads from left to so we're gonna stack one on top of the other. Mike, any objections to that? You guys don't. You guys don't like my design?

**Mark:** I can see you guys don't like my design.

**Darrell:** I don't, you know what? You are the artist. I don't.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** What do you want me to do? May

**Darrell:** But

**Mark:** make them Siamese twins, like conjoined bodies.

**Darrell:** I just don't understand your vision. Let's just say that

**Mark:** I,

**Mike:** to see your vision,

**Darrell:** is

**Mike:** we trust you. We trust you.

**Darrell:** because

**Mark:** know what? After this call, I'm gonna get a little bit of AI to render something for me, and then we're gonna put it in the background and that's what's gonna happen all night long.

**Mike:** Nice.

**Mark:** All night long. We're gonna find something because that's just,

**Darrell:** It is gonna

**Mark:** I thi.

**Darrell:** of those Beatle, was it Beetle crap? Like posts where he, like the weird AI shit, like the Trump baby.

**Mark:** Oh gosh, that Trump baby is

**Darrell:** He's on

**Mark:** he was a, yeah, he's pretty big. But no, and I won't make it so extravagant. It'll just be a picture. It won't be anything animated or [00:32:00] gross or nasty. It's just now I've got a vision in my head. But if I could get

**Darrell:** but you do agree too, is too, for that two people, for that

**Mark:** too for that piece of real estate, I will agree to that.

**Darrell:** An item, right? You can't

**Mark:** You can't say one without the other because they

**Darrell:** and then leave out cheat. Exactly.

**Mark:** no, and it's gotta read Che and Chong, so they both gotta go there. It's all or nothing. Because they made those efforts and influenced the cannabis space in every era.

**Darrell:** Sorry, Mike. I think it's on Netflix. It might look it up. Look up up in smoke.

**Mike:** All

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** Yes. Up in smoke.

**Darrell:** I think that's on there.

**Mark:** I would definitely recommend that movie. That's the best one.

**Mike:** this.

**Mark:** That's the best one. And to be clear, every movie they've ever made,

**Darrell:** 11 at night, dude. It's

**Mike:** I will fall. I

**Darrell:** watch it.

**Mike:** to this. I will fall

**Mark:** you probably will fall asleep again. Like it's it's very an,

**Darrell:** not gonna make it to the play button

**Mark:** It's not moderate.

**Darrell:** couch.

**Mark:** modern day comedy, but it's cultural. It's culturally it's culturally [00:33:00] necessary for you to watch that. Yeah.

**Darrell:** because you think of how it pissed people off back

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** and

**Mark:** And you're, it's nothing like the comedy. The comedy, I wouldn't say I don't have a choice. Lack of a better term. It doesn't age well, but that's a really misleading thing for me to say. It's just that it was good comedy for its time. And what it was trying to do with as much transparency as they could.

**Mark:** The fact that these guys never changed who they were in the process of making their art and the fact that yeah, they were stoners and they didn't think, cannabis was a crime. It was stupid, and they kept showing that over and over in their work.

**Darrell:** jail for it too though.

**Mark:** I know that's the thing that's so fact.

**Mark:** Check me after one of them, or both of them did go to jail for a period of time because of this.

**Darrell:** both went to jail like earlier on, but got hit up for something big and he went away for a

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** years.

**Mark:** but then you see someone like Cheech, he gets really good acting roles, like he's on Law and order or something like that.

**Darrell:** Yeah. He

**Mark:** one of those, one of those harder roles, [00:34:00] so it's oh dang, like these guys really just, they survived Hollywood and the judgment of everything.

**Mark:** So yes, you get to be. I'm chiseling both of you in granite right now. It's gonna be beautiful, which leads us to our Lincoln. This is the fourth position in the mountain. If no one knows about Abraham linking, that's really sad. Assassinated obviously. But before that, the leader of the union in the Civil War, abolishing slavery and all that stuff was part of the agenda.

**Mark:** He stands on the winning side of history. Let's be honest. And he is a controversial figure to some, not to me, but, he is an icon and he is on the $5 bill.

**Darrell:** Sorry, I

**Mark:** what?

**Darrell:** you.

**Mark:** Go ahead.

**Darrell:** on the winning side of history.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** The dude was assassinated, not winning from that dude.

**Mark:** The winning side of Civil War [00:35:00] history, not his own personal history.

**Darrell:** I'm like,

**Mark:** Let me rephrase that. The winning side of US Civil War history, not his own personal legacy. Yeah that, I apologize. Rest in peace, Mr. Lincoln. Fun fact. One of my coworkers, old coworkers, from a few years back. Is like a great granddaughter of Abraham Lincoln.

**Mark:** Her last name was Lincoln. Is Lincoln I say in the, yeah.

**Mike:** another person named Lincoln.

**Mark:** Yeah. That's related. That's related. Abraham Lincoln.

**Mike:** a coworker.

**Mark:** And

**Mike:** How

**Mark:** she sh

**Mike:** forever rich from being

**Mark:** I have no idea. I have no idea. If you think about it, like I don't think Lincoln was rich back in the day. Like they were struggling to to make ends meet there.

**Mark:** He had a divided nation and no internet. I don't know. At any rate, now if you were a Jefferson, no, you were rich because you had money from the French. You had money from being a founding father. You, your name is on the [00:36:00] Declaration of Independence. Or the US Constitution? Probably both.

**Mark:** The signatures probably on both. Who knows? And like all of these original documents, like you gotta be on the OG documents to be the founding fathers, to get that leg legacy wealth. I'd say if you are a legacy child of anyone printed on any denomination of our money, you probably are like legacy rich.

**Mark:** If you came from Alexander Hamilton, and all that stuff. I. Then I have to say about Lincoln too, 'cause he's on the $5 bill. So I don't know. At any rate. See, I can, I can't. That's why I should never teach. INI shouldn't, I should not teach your kids US history.

**Darrell:** I'm

**Mark:** am not.

**Darrell:** the point

**Mike:** No point.

**Mark:** there was no point because I just, I blew the IIII, I blew it all out of the water.

**Darrell:** I was waiting for you to land the plane. Land the plane, already watching it circling around.

**Mark:** I think we'll go here then we will just, we'll just do [00:37:00] that. At any rate, yeah, I didn't land that one. But.

**Darrell:** four. Number four.

**Mark:** Number four.

**Mike:** number four

**Mark:** Mike, thank you for these.

**Mike:** all that, Mark, who's number four?

**Mark:** I don't know, but it's definitely a sativa, whatever. This is definitely a sativa. I am feeling very creative. Yeah, it's a sativa and it's uplift it. It very much is smokey's edibles sativa uplift.

**Darrell:** haven't tried.

**Mark:** Yeah, it's

**Darrell:** likes them. She says they taste good.

**Mark:** there you go. How do you like them Apples? Very nice. Holler at me. All right.

**Mike:** So who's number four?

**Mark:** Let's see. Now we don't have to go that far. We don't have to go back to the seventies or eighties. We can even go to the nineties now. We got we got Dr. Dre who Tran who has helped. Who has helped transcend.

**Darrell:** Lily Nelson,

**Mark:** Willie already has the number two spot. We don't need to be going there. Hold up.

**Mike:** [00:38:00] he doesn't.

**Mark:** Yeah. Didn't he put him in number?

**Mike:** Bob

**Mark:** Bob Marley. Oh, Snoop Dogg. That's right. Snoop Cheech and Chong in the num, in the third position.

**Mike:** Nelson's on there.

**Darrell:** And Willie Nelson. Thank you.

**Darrell:** Thank you.

**Mike:** what it's appropriate because Abe Lincoln's career was, not that he was gone.

**Mark:** Whoa whoa. Whoa.

**Mike:** John Wilkes Booth,

**Mark:** See, made me

**Mark:** At Puff Mike should be teaching US history, not me.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** booth got him

**Mark:** No, we got a little bit. We got a little bit of time. Let's think critically about our fourth position here. Is it really gonna be Willie Nelson?

**Mike:** I don't know.

**Mark:** See? It's like

**Mike:** Seth Rogan. I don't know

**Mike:** Who.

**Mark:** no. I said he gets flowers, but he doesn't get he no.

**Mike:** oh let us

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mark:** Okay. Hold on.

**Mike:** who else do you know that smokes weed other than me and Darrell now and Seth Rogan.

**Mark:** Does Dave Chappelle belong on there? No.

**Mike:** No.

**Darrell:** [00:39:00] funny.

**Mark:** Does Cat Williams deserve to be on there?

**Mike:** weed.

**Mark:** No, I don't. I know that's why I need you to keep, I'm gonna throw out names and I like that. Validate by thinking that we like you. Don't think weed. You have to find that. That affinity of it with that person that I'm about to name drop each time.

**Mark:** Okay. So we say no to Dave Chappelle. We say no to Kat Williams.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Okay, good. All right. So we're gonna throw out every comedian.

**Mike:** Kevin Hart. Let's throw him out too.

**Mark:** No, he doesn't even has, he has nothing to do with that stuff. Let's see here. Oh, how about a.

**Mike:** went to the Museum of Cannabis, right?

**Mark:** A long time ago in a kingdom far away. In a pre covid world. Yes, we did.

**Mike:** Who's famous in there? They should probably be the

**Mark:** All right, hold up.

**Mike:** the doctor,

**Mark:** Hold on.

**Mike:** of

**Mark:** At Puff Provisions, Mark. At Puff Provisions, Mark still has some. We have some legacy [00:40:00] magazines here. All right, so we got, we, we don't just mess around here, we do our research, so we got time, marijuana goes Main Street, a little bit of research there.

**Mark:** We got time, marijuana, the medical movement, a little bit right there. And then lo and behold, I'm here on the Green Entrepreneur Magazine in. The person I said to give flowers to is actually on the cover,

**Darrell:** Oh,

**Mark:** but

**Mike:** Eth.

**Mark:** Van Ian, Snoop, he's already on there. Can you believe that? Gwyneth Paltrow's on there.

**Darrell:** captain Picard.

**Mark:** Captain Picard is on here.

**Mark:** Can you believe that?

**Darrell:** think

**Mark:** So let's take a look at this.

**Darrell:** He's a big advocate for it.

**Mike:** What? What is it for? Is it for those that are investing in cannabis?

**Mark:** Yeah. So ba Oh, see, look at this. Look. Here we go. I'm doing this off the fly. This is to, this is

**Mark:** Totally informal.

**Darrell:** you the paper.

**Mark:** I'm gonna read you the paper. Mike, you want me to read you the [00:41:00] paper? We got Cheech and Chong right there. We got Mike Tyson, we got Justin Trudeau, the former Canadian PM Whoopi Goldberg. We got Susan Sarandon for crying out loud.

**Mark:** Dave Chappelle, Nick Offerman, Kevin Smith. You remember those movies from Kevin Smith?

**Mark:** I see. Of course. We already said Jimmy Buffet Here. Let's da

**Mike:** We just split Chi and Tonks head.

**Mark:** look at that. The person we keep going back and forth on Willie Nelson is on there. Martha Stewart for crying out loud is on here. Yeah, Damien Marley, you know

**Darrell:** The son.

**Mark:** dad, the son of Bob, but Bob deserves to be there. Not Damien. Not Damien. And

**Mike:** of the Marley family.

**Mark:** crying out loud. The man's been gone for so many years, but Steve Jobs is on there.

**Mike:** Wow.

**Mark:** Yeah. That the Shark Tank [00:42:00] guy. Damon, John, the FUBU guy.

**Darrell:** No,

**Mark:** No.

**Darrell:** not

**Mark:** No. Okay. So you got Mike Tyson. No, Mike, I know this isn't good. We need someone, we need this piece of granite number four spot to solidify this monument. Lincoln did that for Mount for the Real Mount Rushmore. What are we doing for this one?

**Mark:** Who else am I overlooking on this? Like he, he legalized the hemp bill, the farm bill. Sure, I'll give you that, but that wasn't enough. No president, again, like you said earlier, is gonna be deserving of this until they actually legalize this. So no president one through 47 aren't deserving of being on this mountain quite yet.

**Mark:** They did nothing, absolutely nothing to help push it forward.

**Darrell:** Yeah, I think that's the main point, right? [00:43:00] These are people who

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** push

**Mark:** In some way, yeah. They help transcend it in their own way.

**Darrell:** list there for that magazine. I could disagree with about half of those.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** Yeah. Because I don't know if they're, they were like us. They're like, oh, we need a fourth one, and they just start naming people off.

**Mark:** is there a woman we're overlooking from this one?

**Mark:** Come on, there's gotta be a famous woman that, that, that took this by the horns and ran the ball with it. I can't think of one

**Darrell:** that did it, but they didn't really like openly talk about it, so that's hard to say. they, it was almost as if it was for like an accessory.

**Mark:** that did.

**Darrell:** It's just hard to come up with one for a woman.

**Mike:** For me personally.

**Mark:** Go for it.

**Mike:** I'm

**Mark:** No. Nothing. Nothing. This is open-ended. This isn't stupid. This is open-Ended

**Mike:** This is just me personally being ridiculous in the [00:44:00] clouds. but to you guys, what is the most famous phrase regarding smoking weed, like

**Mark:** the most.

**Mike:** or lyric

**Mark:** Fraser Lyric

**Darrell:** Smoke weed every day.

**Mark:** smoke weed every day. Yeah. Nate Dogg.

**Mike:** Smoke. We got, I think we need another dog on there.

**Mark:** Hell yeah. I am so down with that. If Nate rest in peace to Nate Dogg, I'm so down with that because it closes every, it ends perfectly and the way he sings it, and it's like singing and rapping at the same time.

**Darrell:** So he

**Mark:** And he does it

**Mike:** a club when they put that on

**Mark:** and it drops when the,

**Mike:** smoke

**Mark:** it ends with that.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** And it's and mind you, it's like a second or two after the song ends

**Mark:** Yep. It's like its own drop. It's its own drop.

**Darrell:** The DJ [00:45:00] plays it through the silent, through the, through that gap. That's the

**Mark:** And it actually,

**Darrell:** beat going, but

**Mark:** but then it.

**Darrell:** song,

**Mark:** And the, yep. The DJ also knows, they let that lyric ride and they use it to transition into something else that drops, huh?

**Darrell:** it.

**Mark:** Yeah. And it's it always transitions so well into the next song and you're just like, okay.

**Darrell:** being on the end would be just like that lyric.

**Mark:** so meta. It is it's like you look at from left to right and then it's like smoke weed every day.

**Darrell:** When you see him, when you see him, you

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** When you see him, Nate Dogg on there.

**Mark:** I am super.

**Darrell:** day.

**Mark:** I'm super happy putting Nate Dogg as the number four spot to end the mountain and make a statement out of it all. I'm happy with that. I could, I will. I will definitely start chiseling our three by sixes. Mike, is that what you said? We only have so much budgeted for this.

**Darrell:** much of this, again, where were you putting, which mountain were you gonna use?

**Mark:** We're. I was just trying to keep in since I don't know geography too well. E evidently we're just gonna put it into [00:46:00] something that we can tell

**Darrell:** the

**Mark:** the amount of San,

**Darrell:** great

**Mark:** we're gonna put it on Soledad. We're gonna put, I'm sure the people of La Jolla would be super happy with my decision and their taxpayer dollar it, but it, I take that back.

**Mark:** No period dollars. It's out of pocket, so you didn't have to pay for this, so you didn't waste any money whatsoever.

**Mike:** Got you.

**Mark:** Exactly, gentlemen, I am happy with that. We got at the number one spot, Bob Marley, at the number two spot. We got Snoop, DO, double G, sharing the third spot, Cheech and Chong. I think we just don't know if you're gonna put him in totem poll order, or you want me to do him side to side.

**Darrell:** Like a diagonal

**Mark:** See, look at that you guys are like,

**Mark:** The word.

**Darrell:** like offset, right? Yeah. But then it's weird because how does that kind of join to number four? Because you

**Mark:** It doesn't have to join a number four. These are standalone people in different eras, and you know they don't. Yeah. Okay. And then in the final spot, [00:47:00] smoke weed every day. Let the beat drop. Let the lyric drop. Let the silence occur, the transitions. Nate Dogg. Rest in peace. Rest in peace to him. I knew he passed away.

**Mark:** I didn't know, what's his name passed away. What's his name again? Snoop Dogg. That song you just shared with us today?

**Mike:** Dogg.

**Darrell:** Oh.

**Mark:** No, not Nate Dogg.

**Mike:** uh,

**Mark:** Dogg and to Tom Petty.

**Darrell:** Tom

**Mark:** Yeah, man, it's been so far since anything that predates 2020. It's been hard to remember. So you know, it is what it is.

**Mark:** Gentlemen, thank you for another wonderful edition of the Puff Provisions podcast. The Mount Rushmore of Canada as defined by our team has been decided. So the next time you are in San Diego visiting your favorite dispensary and you decide to make a hike up La Jolla and you see something chiseled in particular and you have no idea as to why, and it seems out of place, it was because of us.

**Mark:** You're [00:48:00] welcome. You're welcome. You're welcome. Anything else? Or did I just completely,

**Mike:** money.
