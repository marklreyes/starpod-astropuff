[00:00:00] What's up everyone, my name is Mark. And those two over there, that's Darrell and Mike. Two of my like minded friends who I roped into having adult conversations powered by cannabis. We're simply three dads, husbands, and full time desktop athletes striving to figure out how recreational cannabis plugs into our modern day world.

Why do vape pens look like USB drives? Should I smoke it or eat it? What would my kids think? We're problem solving our way through this type of mentality on a daily basis. And we decided to capture it in audio for those of you pondering the same things. But be warned, we speculate a ton and get stuck in God's fridge quite a bit.

You can blame that on the munchies. So if you're comfy with that, come on in. Pull up a chair and kick back. And welcome to the Puff Provisions Podcast.

**Mark:** [00:01:00] Every day.

**Mike:** if you're not

**Mike:** Wait, that is alcohol. It's like what, point, four point something?

**Darrell:** It's actually five. It's five, and you know what it tastes like? It reminds you of a squeeze it.

**Mark:** Oh,

**Mike:** Oh, let's get

**Mark:** wait. Squeeze. It was the thing that looked like a Coke bottle, but it was plastic, right? And it was a fruit juice [00:02:00] inside

**Mike:** Yeah, and you squeeze it. Yeah.

**Darrell:** Can you imagine? I'm sure now it's not even allowed. Can you imagine how toxic

**Mark:** a squeeze it. Oh hell no. Yeah.

**Mike:** lined up right here.

**Darrell:** all right here. It's just the linings of my

**Mark:** Yep.

**Darrell:** intestine just right

**Mark:** And that gentlemen leads me into tonight because it's been a while Summer is over at the time of this recording unofficially, we haven't hit the equinox quite yet

**Darrell:** Not really with this

**Mark:** Welcome to happy hour at the Puff Provisions podcast where tonight we're just gonna lay it out there Whatever is on your mind echo it out puff your chest exhale.

**Mark:** What the fuck has been going on in life? You know because as three busy cannabis dads with their own constraints dynamics and challenges Being contributors to Earth, contributors to our family, while trying to maintain our own headspace while not losing it. While Mark here is wearing a High Rollers Brazilian [00:03:00] Jiu Jitsu t shirt here.

**Mark:** No, it's one of the old ones, Smoke Train Repeat, just in army green. Holler at me if you want to know more about that. I'm just, they're still around, they're still around. I have, yeah,

**Darrell:** They're still around, right? There's actually another one. I forget

**Mark:** They're a cannabis Jiu Jitsu team. Fight Club? What are they? Wait, you said there's another one?

**Mark:** They do cannabis and martial arts?

**Darrell:** what they're called.

**Mark:** Okay, you gotta look it up later, but that's not the homework for tonight.

**Darrell:** Yeah. Yeah, i'll look

**Mark:** Alright, if you find out before this conversation ends, let me know, let us know what it is. But yeah, tonight was really just a, my oh my, this year is almost over. Welcome to September at the time of this recording.

**Mark:** And I'm saying summer is almost over, but again, at the time of this recording, I don't know where, how else the weather is behaving out in different cities, but here in sunny San Diego, it's taking it a little too literally being over a hundred degrees. September and it's hot as fuck. It's hot as fuck. So my first question for tonight is gentlemen [00:04:00] How do you like to cool down?

**Mark:** This is a very unorthodox question that I shouldn't be asking as residents of san diego But I have to because this is fucking hot and I can already tell Darrell is Cooling down by way of wearing a tank top instead of a t shirt So he's showing a little bit more than his only fans account tonight So you're getting a little bit of a freebie on tonight's pub provisions podcast Give me some helpful tips on how you like to cool down You Mike, you go first.

**Mike:** We run AC pretty much 24 7

**Mark:** Are you eco friendly with that at 78 degrees at the recommended eco friendly rate?

**Mike:** No.

**Mark:** that a lie or is that the truth?

**Mike:** Yeah. Yeah. May

**Mark:** Maybe it is.

**Mike:** lower. Maybe

**Mark:** I'm telling you, I do. I am a nerd.

**Darrell:** Is that snow back there Mike? 96

**Mike:** Where's

**Mark:** If anything I can tell you is that here where is it in? You guys are filming out at Chula Vista and it was like, what today? What was today's high in Chula Vista?

**Mike:** yeah. Think 95, 96.

**Mark:** County, Escondido, 102.

**Darrell:** Yeah, it's

**Mark:** 102. And let me put this.

**Darrell:** yeah[00:05:00]

**Mark:** Oh, of course. And I did. I know. Thankfully I had the ASI guys come and redo all of the AC before summer even hit. So we got the top notch. My pipes are clean. My box is good. The fan blades are dusted. Everything is brand new. So it feels good,

**Mike:** Yeah. It's super

**Mark:** but can I tell you something, even with a super efficient, super brand new HVAC system, 78 degrees against 102 outside of those windows,

**Mike:** still fighting,

**Mark:** a fight.

**Mike:** Still

**Mark:** a fight because you can feel the heat wanting to try to come in. And you're like, I don't know SDG& E, maybe if I tap it down to 77 or 76, could I do that? Could I do that? Not to mention what?

**Darrell:** yeah, not to mention every other house in your

**Mark:** Exactly. Every other house. And thankfully we haven't had any of those rolling blackouts or whatever they do to What do they call it?

**Darrell:** knock on wood. You

**Mark:** Not I know. Seriously.

**Darrell:** wood, man.

**Mark:** Not no. What's the thing that they do that isn't a power outage? Where like they shut They

**Darrell:** brownout.

**Mark:** No. [00:06:00] That Those are the extremes.

**Mark:** There's a less extreme thing where, they take governance of your, thermostat. Yeah. They do they, basically regulate when you, you can turn on your AC again, if you opt into those programs, there's something I don't have the buzzwords, but, it's, to prevent blackouts from occurring.

**Mark:** That's why they do that technique. I don't know what it is. So thankfully, I haven't.

**Mike:** So

**Mark:** Exactly. Yeah, the pad, the grids aren't being stressed out. So like they you don't have blackouts or anything. You still have energy. These are modern day systems connected to the internet, by the way.

**Mark:** I don't believe this applies to any old school dial up honey wells out there but yeah, so i've been competing with that It's hot. It's hot as fuck, dude.

**Darrell:** Give an

**Mark:** Give an example. Okay, so sure You

**Darrell:** Give an example. If it gets too hot, if it gets too, if you use up too much, does your service

**Mark:** No

**Darrell:** override your thermostat, just

**Mark:** But very close. So what happens is if let's just say right now that the

**Darrell:** too

**Mark:** is in high demand everywhere and [00:07:00] SDG& E can't support all that. What they'll do is.

**Mark:** Me, Mark, I'm tapping on my touchscreen

**Mark:** tap it down to 75, 73, or as cold as Mike's house at 68 degrees.

**Darrell:** this and

**Mark:** E won't let me.

**Mark:** They're like, they're, you cannot do that until 7 o'clock at night or until 9 o'clock at night. And then that, whatever that,

**Mark:** you get what I'm saying. I don't have the authority to control that right now. Suppress that.

**Mark:** It's not a blackout. Yeah, peak hours. Yeah. So I. My thermostat, hasn't happened this, for this summer, but in previous summers, I had that, I experienced that quite a bit, Dude, I don't know. I don't know how people in Arizona or New Mexico or Texas do it. People leaving California to go to Texas.

**Mark:** How do you feel about that? Was that the right choice?

**Darrell:** I feel like over there, man,

**Mark:** They're solar all the way, but if you wanted to go outside and have some fun, your face melts off the moment you step out the door,

**Darrell:** Oh,

**Darrell:** Good luck.

**Mark:** At least here even at

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** 102, I'm struggling , I'm still going about my day and I know it's not going to be forever, but if you live in Arizona, dude, they've [00:08:00] been going through 100 days worth of 100 degree or record breaking temperatures, I don't think I could sustain that.

**Darrell:** They've already, in our neighborhood, they've had some rolling brownouts or blackouts, whatever you want to call it. After Jiu Jitsu class tonight, I went to our local Vons and the

**Mark:** Oh,

**Darrell:** center, like a third of the parking lights and some of the buildings

**Mark:** Was the actual grocery store

**Darrell:** So yeah.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** No, the Vons was on, was up and running, but like the adjacents, the stores in the area, the ones that at least that were closed and some of the parking lights

**Mark:** got it. Dang, I haven't experienced that yet. I hope I

**Mark:** wood yet again.

**Darrell:** It's funny because in that same shopping, in

**Darrell:** Center, there's a Vons and then there's an In N Out and that In N Out is popping.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** they're probably sucking from the grid,

**Mark:** You never know. They

**Darrell:** grid.

**Mark:** could have backup generators. I have no idea how that stuff works. You never know. Yeah. Got the money to do it. Yeah.

**Darrell:** Illuminati, man. They're like the [00:09:00] Illuminati of burgers, man. They probably have

**Mark:** So catching up with you guys and things of that nature. You know what, summer ended. Yeah. Kid, kid. No,

**Darrell:** yet.

**Mark:** not yet. When does summer officially end? Oh, okay. So later on in September, time of this recording right now is early September. So yeah, you're right on that.

**Mark:** Catching up here

**Darrell:** But still,

**Mark:** I'm not going to talk politics because we did, we've done that before four years ago. I'm just going to tease it in a little bit.

**Darrell:** you're doing

**Mark:** you want to vote for. Agreed?

**Mark:** Don't give a shit?

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** exactly.

**Mark:** See? That's the whole thing. Look at that. That's the whole thing. It's still exhausting. It's still exhausting and at the same time, Exactly. It's just you hope for the best. Whatever team you're on, good luck to you. Hope for the best,

**Mike:** It's kinda, it's crazy how people are still fighting though.

**Mark:** which I respect because you love your [00:10:00] country. You love, you want policy that you thoughtfully believe in things of that nature. Oh

**Mike:** the

**Mark:** Yeah, but it leads into being an idiot when you're too extreme, but on both sides This is both sides. This is super red and super blues You know idiots like you people have forgotten that we're swirling on this rock together and we have no choice But to swirl on this rock together You don't need to because this is how exhausting it is because the thing is these idiots Are seriously putting all of these candidates up like they're the second coming of Jesus.

**Mark:** They're not just they're people just like you and me and they're gonna make mistakes They're gonna make one person happy and the other person pissed off with one decision that they make each time So what the fuck chill the fuck out go smoke some weed Go hug a family member, go hug somebody, someone get me a fucking fan, cause it's fucking hot right now. Oh, don't worry, we'll blip her out yet again. That's what I did. [00:11:00] Don't worry,

**Darrell:** We're

**Mark:** A. I. will, will put it.

**Darrell:** and she's,

**Mark:** That's crazy.

**Mike:** crazy.

**Darrell:** one is a, The

**Mark:** Oh, knocked out sleep?

**Darrell:** She's

**Mark:** Very good.

**Darrell:** She's already in

**Mark:** Good night, sweetheart.

**Darrell:** She's trying to run for, her class representative, so

**Mark:** What is class representative? Is that like class president stuff? Would you say?

**Darrell:** Not really, because they participate in the student council, but

**Mark:** The reason why I had to ask is because you said that word representative, but remember when we were kids, it's I want to run for class president, vice president, treasurer, secretary. You remember those four roles? So it's not like that,

**Mark:** But similar.

**Darrell:** It's similar, so she's a rep,

**Mike:** Hey,

**Darrell:** so she's gonna represent like her class at the

**Mark:** You know what this reminds me of, Mike?

**Darrell:** And,

**Mark:** representing your district in Hunger Games.

**Mike:** that

**Mark:** This is what it is. That should be it. So do they have, do the peers have to vote her in? And is she competing with other?

**Darrell:** Her class has to,

**Mike:** class?

**Darrell:** yeah, her class has to, I don't know who she's, who's competing with her because there's only two

**Mark:** Does she have to write like a speech or draw [00:12:00] posters or make?

**Darrell:** working on, yeah.

**Mark:** Posters or a speech? Does a young child like her? Ooh,

**Darrell:** Both.

**Mark:** speech.

**Darrell:** And here's the kicker, is she's in dual

**Mark:** Oh you're gonna have to use a little chat GPT, my friend, to help you out.

**Darrell:** Google

**Mark:** Can I give you a word of caution of Google Translate? I've worked with many international people. You might say the wrong thing with Google Translate, so err with a side of caution, okay? Okay, good.

**Darrell:** We, yeah, I agree. We have to,

**Mark:** Yeah, there's nuances to because it's so mechanical the way google translate does its thing that it's just like you Don't get that colloquialism or that cultural intonation and tone and you could be saying the wrong shit Yeah, or you could be saying the wrong shit and you could offend somebody and that's the last thing you want a young kid doing that and here we go, world war three starting at the elementary schools You got

**Darrell:** That's what we've been working on tonight is I was helping her write up her speech and then she has to [00:13:00] translate it. Good. Can translate it on her own. Like she doesn't need me. I'm the one that needs

**Mark:** you got any advice for other

**Darrell:** posters,

**Mark:** dads out there that are probably going through the same thing?

**Darrell:** the

**Mark:** their kid wants to run for a student council

**Darrell:** it

**Mark:** What do they do? What's the priority? The speech or the poster?

**Mark:** Really? But the poster with a catchphrase, remember when we used to watch professional wrestling and before phones existed, iPhones existed, you actually had to carry a poster to express your thoughts kind of thing? Yeah. You remember those days?

**Darrell:** gosh,

**Mark:** those days?

**Darrell:** that. It's funny because right now at their school they're still having, I think they're finishing up student council elections, so throughout the school everyone has a

**Mark:** You mean

**Darrell:** who's running for whatever. it just took me back to how that was, how we did it when we were younger. And now, like the creativity is through the roof now. I think with just all the things

**Mark:** I use a social media tool in this too? I hope not. Thank gosh.

**Darrell:** really, but some do the creativity is pretty, pretty up there. There was one kid that did poster, I think, I forgot he[00:14:00]

**Mark:** Eh, it doesn't matter.

**Darrell:** think

**Mark:** What was so creative about it?

**Darrell:** Treasurer, but pretty good.

**Mark:** What do you mean?

**Darrell:** legos

**Mark:** Like an

**Darrell:** like he had his

**Mark:** actual three dimensional Lego block?

**Darrell:** had a picture

**Mark:** Oh, dang.

**Darrell:** Yeah, it like stuck out. I think the only problem was he put it he didn't put it the hardback, poster board. He put it on

**Mark:** Oh, so it wasn't supporting the weight of the block. Trouble buster. Yeah.

**Darrell:** man. It's a light cardstock.

**Darrell:** That's the best I could describe it, but it should have been like super stiff, right? But it was pretty cool. Like the concept, I

**Mark:** Nice.

**Darrell:** cool. I'm like, no, you got to make sure that no one, messes

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** your Legos.

**Mark:** That makes sense.

**Darrell:** I'd super glue that out. I'd super glue that on there, but I don't know how he did it, but it was pretty impressive.

**Darrell:** But man, it's a different game. to how we used to do it. I think we would like, I don't know, what were we? We were like grassroots campaign, walk

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** hands, buy some chips, buy some sodas, vote for me, give your, your AOL screen name, Hey, reach me here

**Mark:** Another thing I wanted to catch up on just real quick, pivoting [00:15:00] to, Mike for a second. Good to know. First off, I didn't mean to cut you off. Good to know that if we're going to promote something, we're going to use Lego blocks on thicker cardstock. Not flimsy card stock. Maybe we,

**Darrell:** creative.

**Mark:** Maybe that's a Marketing technique for Puff Provisions podcast at some point, but it's a Mike and it's all, he's got a couple, what's the word I'm looking for.

**Mark:** What's the alter egos, if you will, he went viral. He, if no one here knows, he's also an MC, a wedding MC. No, yes we are just to a certain extent, but she went viral on a Filipino IG account, that's really followed by a ton of people out there. If anyone knows, at Puff Revisions, Mike is for hire.

**Mark:** If you ever want to do that. That's all I wanted to do. I just wanted to say that. You went good viral.

**Mike:** You trying to

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Mike:** wedding.

**Mark:** is good viral. Yeah,

**Mike:** to have a

**Mark:** that's what I wanted to say. If you wanted to have a lit wedding, because Mike would lead the

**Darrell:** Hashtag Mike does

**Mark:** and we provide the weed to your weddings. Legally. We'll find a way.

**Mark:** Darrell and I will. Yep,

**Darrell:** If it's in

**Mark:** Darrell and I will be [00:16:00] behind the counter bud tending. That's what we will be doing. That is exactly what we'll be doing.

**Mark:** Yes.

**Mike:** I wonder how many weddings Actually

**Mark:** what?

**Mike:** a weed bar,

**Mark:** I bet you there are legal, regulations to that, right? Because you got first off, Let's go.

**Mike:** You just got to

**Mark:** That's true.

**Mike:** with it. That's it.

**Mark:** That's true. But the liability involved with that, right?

**Darrell:** It would have to

**Mark:** For sure.

**Darrell:** venue. Yeah, it would

**Darrell:** Out.

**Mike:** not charging, you're not charging guests. You just, say for instance, I buy the weed, hire you and Darrell

**Mark:** so roll stuff. Yeah roll stuff. Yeah. And on

**Mike:** and then you hand that out.

**Mike:** Definitely bud

**Darrell:** That works.

**Mike:** hire.

**Mark:** the basis of donation only so you don't, we don't financially obligate anyone or make any kind of legal transaction, right? Donations only and 21 and up. Show your ID, right? If you want one, show your ID. What?

**Darrell:** are we so it's just gonna be

**Darrell:** J's? Are

**Mark:** Yeah, the traditional stuff.

**Darrell:** This is just for sanitary reasons, [00:17:00] right? Sanitary reasons, right? Because if we bust,

**Mike:** using a bong

**Mark:** not sharing a bong with 300 people at a wedding. That's gross.

**Darrell:** No

**Mark:** Why would I do that?

**Darrell:** Like a tabletop vaporizer?

**Mike:** You use different

**Mark:** Too much overhead. Too much overhead. Simplify the problem.

**Darrell:** too

**Mark:** The overhead is too much.

**Darrell:** like we'd be,

**Mark:** Yeah, exactly.

**Darrell:** be yeah, we'd be

**Mark:** have to, I'd have to jump to every table to fix the technical issue. No it's paper and flower. That's it. That's what I'll do. Paper and Flower.

**Darrell:** Why don't we just

**Mark:** Why don't we, what,

**Darrell:** get one of those this, have you seen that TikTok video where the kid MacGyvered

**Mark:** what did he do?

**Darrell:** and he put a bunch of, put a

**Mark:** that's, what's his name? The, that Asian guy that that with IG, a big IG account. Yeah.

**Darrell:** who it was,

**Mark:** That was like a few years ago.

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mark:** Is he even still on?

**Darrell:** Oh, years ago.

**Mark:** I don't see anything in my algorithms anymore

**Mark:** From that guy.

**Mark:** Do you?

**Darrell:** my, my only gripe

**Mark:** Exactly. Yeah.

**Darrell:** Like he probably wasted like

**Mark:** way all of that.

**Darrell:** to,

**Mark:** Exactly. There's [00:18:00] no way all of that hot boxing that he did could convert into his lungs or anybody else's lungs that he shared it with.

**Mark:** That was a real big waste of fire. That's a ton of money that got burned up.

**Mike:** And this is a 40 year old dad

**Mark:** Yeah, that's

**Mike:** If I was 30, 20, if I was 20 years old, I wouldn't be concerned

**Mark:** good.

**Mike:** but put that much heat so close to the, to something that is not supposed to accept that type is not

**Mark:** Yup.

**Mike:** that type of heat. You

**Mark:** Yup.

**Mike:** in the air.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** plastic fumes in the air.

**Mark:** But see,

**Mike:** that's

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** 20 year old,

**Darrell:** free.

**Mark:** year old AptoF for Visions Mike is fuck it, with his squeeze it on his hand and his blunt on his elbow. Yeah.

**Darrell:** had strong

**Mark:** See, that's the difference. That's the difference here we are as cannabis dads these days. It's just like we think about these tiny details that we didn't back then.

**Mark:** And now we're thinking of it for you, each loyal listener that's out there. In America

**Darrell:** now you would know this, Mike. This is probably something I'm more curious about. And we'll probably just toss it out [00:19:00] there. Who

**Mike:** What's

**Darrell:** think would gather the bigger crowd? Would it be the weed bar or would it be the open bar?

**Mark:** Open bar.

**Darrell:** open

**Mark:** I agree to that too.

**Darrell:** Still

**Mark:** much as I hate to agree with that,

**Mike:** yeah,

**Mark:** first. There's still a lack of understanding and fear with the flower bar.

**Darrell:** That's true. And I think like the older folks, right? They probably don't know it so they're probably gonna stay away from it and they'll stick to the alcohol probably.

**Mike:** Even those that smoke or have smoked like on occasion, they don't know, reactions are still unpredictable and they're not used to the reaction of weed. So

**Darrell:** Yeah, we don't want

**Mike:** of it. There's

**Darrell:** We don't want

**Mike:** that still that mystique Oh, I have to be home. I have to be in a controlled space and do this.

**Darrell:** We don't want to hurt

**Mark:** we do this all the time we exactly

**Darrell:** We don't

**Mark:** so we do this all the time with this phrase Can you imagine so I'm gonna bring it back. Can you imagine if Mike? Oh my bad.

**Mike:** I don't hear

**Mark:** There you go.

**Mike:** Hold

**Mark:** Sorry

**Mark:** The little AI computer [00:20:00] was like network, and then that's why I went away, but now I'm back. It is the heat.

**Mark:** Even the network is like suffering from the heat.

**Darrell:** are

**Mark:** So we always bring, we, yeah it is.

**Darrell:** on?

**Mark:** But it's not on right now. It's on automatic. It's not on right now. When the, yeah now,

**Mike:** not

**Mark:** when the temperature clicks to a different level, maybe it'll click in and blow some cold air in here again.

**Mike:** It gets higher

**Mark:** yep. Now you're out of frame.

**Mark:** Look, see, even your network's struggling. Look, he's struggling. Look at his picture. It's gone.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** Dude,

**Mark:** put a,

**Mike:** this heat is

**Darrell:** Is

**Mark:** good thing we got, yeah, I can hear you,

**Darrell:** Hold on,

**Mark:** Good thing we got a,

**Mike:** you. Yeah

**Mark:** it's fine. Just leave. Can you leave the session and come? Hey

**Darrell:** Oh,

**Mark:** I see

**Mike:** we

**Darrell:** We're

**Darrell:** Back

**Mark:** this heat is hurting all the technology on the Puff Provisions podcast.

**Darrell:** heat is hurting

**Mark:** We always say in all of our episodes, I've noticed this whenever we small talk, can you imagine? So I'm going to bring, can you imagine back? Can you imagine if Mike was doing a wedding and you and I were bud tending in the back and every guest with the exception [00:21:00] of minors were high. What would that look like, Mike?

**Mark:** You service more of these things than I ever will. What would that, what would happen? First off, we know we're not doing this at church.

**Mike:** it would be

**Mark:** This is definitely the

**Mike:** no this it would be a

**Mark:** it would, wouldn't it?

**Mike:** It

**Mark:** It would be a vibe.

**Mike:** Yeah,

**Mark:** honestly, too, the music would be,

**Mike:** Yeah,

**Mark:** music would be good.

**Mike:** so a wedding already is about love

**Mark:** Yes.

**Mike:** right?

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Mike:** It's based around love. So everybody, majority of people there are there to have fun and celebrate the couple and have

**Mark:** yeah,

**Mike:** love, right? But if you throw weed in that mix, dude, everybody would just be on cloud nine, right? Cause you're there happy

**Darrell:** It looks,

**Mike:** people loving out

**Darrell:** are you recording already?

**Mike:** and you high and you have good music going.

**Mark:** the only thing I would say would be probably be something to be cautioning about and look this guy's gone again

**Mike:** man. I, so difficulties. I don't hear Mark and then I don't see [00:22:00] or

**Mark:** It's the heat.

**Darrell:** heat. This is the heat.

**Mike:** he is.

**Mark:** It's the heat. Can you hear me now?

**Darrell:** It's the heat. Oh

**Mark:** Oh, no. Am I back?

**Mike:** It's

**Darrell:** turn that AC on. Mark. Turn that AC on.

**Mike:** Lower them, lower a couple of degrees,

**Darrell:** A 78? You gotta bring

**Mark:** am I back?

**Darrell:** 72.

**Mike:** put some

**Mark:** Oh, man. Let's see,

**Darrell:** fan? Start

**Mark:** dude. Are you kidding? Am I back or

**Mike:** Oh, man.

**Darrell:** But the thing though is like, everyone's Everyone's reaction to it would be different, right? I think

**Mike:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Darrell:** If they were to like, say the venue's from 6 to 10. Just throwing that there. 6 to 10. If they start at 9, long's their Episode gonna be, if they have to be home, right?

**Darrell:** You don't want them driving like,

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** right? So but I think

**Mike:** It would

**Darrell:** you bust that out

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** You bust it out like the open bar and it would be like, everybody is like at the hotel. Everyone's at the hotel. We're staying at the hotel

**Darrell:** We got like the what is it called like the Was it called [00:23:00] the hotel the room? Like slots or whatever it's

**Mark:** am I new? I am

**Mike:** Roomblox. There you

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mike:** go.

**Darrell:** there you are. We're back. It's the heat.

**Mark:** So the room block situation You guys are doing fine with this mental model. There's only one piece of caution. Again, now that we're older, you still gotta set good examples in front of the kids, cause here's what's gonna happen. What's that smell? What is that? What's that smell?

**Mike:** They gotta

**Mark:** What is that?

**Mike:** someday.

**Mark:** I don't like that smell.

**Darrell:** That's at some

**Mark:** Why is every, why is everyone doing this? And then you gotta be like that's because we're adults three, I think

**Mike:** Nah, that's why

**Mark:** that's, they're going to be, there's going to be a small subset of kids because what do weddings have, they have flower girls, ring bearers.

**Mark:** There's always outside of them too. There's always going to be at least a few more straggling around that as guests. Whether you control that or not, beyond me, but I'm honest to God, I know that's gonna happen. So [00:24:00] that's also gonna happen at the room block or after party.

**Darrell:** do we send them home with edibles?

**Mark:** And get on the news at 11? I don't think so. So that's another thing too. That's what I would not bring. So as bud tenders, it's flower only, no edibles, so there's no confusion.

**Darrell:** Yes.

**Mark:** Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Whoever gave me a round of applause. Yes. Thank you. That's right. That's right. It's got to be flower only

**Darrell:** that

**Mark:** if we're doing this it's flower only I want to limit the liability I don't want to bring edibles into the play. No, I can already see us fucking up

**Darrell:** bet you no one's fighting. There's gonna be no

**Mark:** Why would there be fighting at a wedding? I thought it was all about love

**Darrell:** Oh, you know you mix

**Darrell:** You once you get alcohol involved, right? It's a different reaction, right?

**Mike:** drama,

**Mark:** brings me to that point Mike

**Darrell:** families, right? You got different families.

**Mark:** Because that brings me to another point because Mike said a majority of people there are there for the love

**Darrell:** no, it's

**Mark:** Oh now the heat not again

**Darrell:** there. You're back. You're

**Mark:** So it's going to be like this. So this is going to be some fun editing to do later on, but that's my problem. Not anybody else's.[00:25:00]

**Mark:** All right. Am I here? Am I here?

**Darrell:** You can get creative.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** hear you. You're good. You're

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** listener's

**Mark:** that's true, dude. It's the network.

**Mike:** no

**Mark:** It's this heat man. It's like really hurting. But no Mike said earlier that a majority of people are there for love So what are the minority? What are the minority there for again? I don't have experience except my own wedding

**Mike:** Haters.

**Mark:** haters exist

**Mark:** On the guest list There's hater there are haters on the guest list

**Darrell:** dude family members, dude. Family

**Mark:** and why the fuck would they go to the wedding in the first place?

**Darrell:** the family.

**Mark:** fucking

**Darrell:** hate.

**Mike:** To

**Darrell:** what they live for. Wanna hate on

**Mark:** I don't want to give them, I don't want to give them weed.

**Darrell:** on

**Mark:** I don't want to give them weed. I don't want to give the,

**Mike:** man.

**Darrell:** maybe they need it the most. Maybe they need it the most.

**Mike:** They need

**Mark:** and then that makes them the most friendliest and the most honest

**Darrell:** We're gonna be

**Mark:** or making new ones

**Darrell:** right.

**Mark:** or making new ones.

**Mike:** Doctor's orders.

**Darrell:** Doctor's orders. Here you go.

**Mark:** Do you notice that, though, in that line of work, Mike? Is that the [00:26:00] majority,

**Darrell:** Like the wind like the wind god, Mike.

**Mark:** okay,

**Mike:** Just summoning

**Mark:** we've established the rules. That's good. Fun fact. You

**Darrell:** Yeah, we're

**Mark:** know what?

**Darrell:** Problems. We're gonna solve

**Mark:** I've switched up my cannabis consumption.

**Darrell:** was

**Mark:** I love weed. You all know that. Let's pull back. Entire podcast, Puff Provisions world is centered around that. However, I'm going to knock, I'm not going to lie.

**Mark:** I've been, it's also been rather exhausting. Sometimes high is too high. So I've been switching it. It can be. And with my, with the way I've been working it, it has. I'm been like, okay, I love it. I'm always gonna love it. I didn't quit it, by the way. But I switched over to CBD. Now, this is a work in progress.

**Mark:** I'm on,

**Mike:** Hold on.

**Mark:** I'm not on THC, I'm on, I'm like CBD, I'm all CBD right now, like CBD flower and stuff like that, or CBD baby.

**Mike:** So you've become a pussy?

**Mark:** Excuse me, but there's still 33 percent THC,

**Mike:** Darrell's

**Mark:** there's still 33 percent THC. [00:27:00] Did you hear me? Am I coming in clear? Am I coming in clear? All

**Darrell:** That was good.

**Mark:** right, I walked into that one. I walked into that one.

**Darrell:** That

**Mike:** Sorry. That was offensive of me. I apologize.

**Darrell:** was good. That was good.

**Mike:** out there that only smoke

**Mark:** Excuse me, but the CBD still has 33 percent THC. It says it on the box. 33 percent THC, 66 percent CBD.

**Darrell:** Okay. The only reason why is this is coming from you before smoked massive joints, like the size of my forearm.

**Mark:** become too much.

**Darrell:** You'd

**Mark:** could burn through that. I could burn. But

**Darrell:** one

**Mark:** the thing is The best way to describe what that is like outside of, yes, it does feel good. You just feel super relaxed. You sleep well, obviously. It's great. Yeah, you get the munchies that's obvious.

**Darrell:** You still get the munchies

**Mark:** Not really the only way [00:28:00] I really nah

**Mark:** But I do still get slight. Euphoric feeling to be perfectly honest, but i'm just super relaxed I'm, like totally relaxed. But no, but here's the thing

**Darrell:** Yes,

**Mark:** as much as i've been hearing these comments I'm, still going to go back to thg. This is only a small test run by the way until i'll leave Until all these products go away

**Mike:** all

**Mark:** for the pod.

**Mark:** Yeah, this is

**Mike:** It's for

**Darrell:** You can't

**Mark:** it's for the gram. Thank you

**Mike:** Okay.

**Darrell:** really call it a tea break. You can't really call it a tea break

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** has

**Mark:** but the thing is okay But

**Darrell:** But

**Mark:** this all three of us here in this room in this virtual room know this That

**Mark:** Weed is strong. Whatever. However, they're cultivating It is fucking stronger than willie. Nelson's weed will ever be okay. Can we be honest about that?

**Darrell:** there's, it's gotten a

**Mark:** fucking potent

**Darrell:** since,

**Mark:** good though.

**Darrell:** I mean compared

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** to

**Mark:** but

**Darrell:** in

**Mark:** now imagine

**Darrell:** It's

**Mark:** people who are older than us that smoked it in their respective college years And now they try to smoke something now or vape something now [00:29:00] or take a dab off something it hits,

**Darrell:** Oh,

**Mark:** right? That's that shit is strong.

**Darrell:** let me share a quick story. We had we, my wife and I, we went, Mike was there, we went on a cruise

**Mark:** yeah

**Darrell:** wife's birthday.

**Darrell:** And she brought her best friend's husband, and he's an avid he actually makes custom, don't know what he called it, I forgot, a spliff? Is that what

**Mark:** Tobacco.

**Darrell:** with

**Mark:** Yes.

**Darrell:** and weed? Is that what,

**Mike:** yeah. Spiff. Yeah. Spiff,

**Darrell:** he makes, when I go, whenever I go to the house, that's what I, that's what he offers me, or spliff, because he likes the tobacco. And he gets his tobacco from like a special place. It's not like cigarette tobacco. It's like specific

**Mike:** yeah.

**Darrell:** tobacco.

**Darrell:** I can't

**Darrell:** Cigarettes, right? But I know that. I smoke his stuff, I get, that

**Darrell:** A cigarette on top of the cannabis high that I normally get. So it's nice, right? You got, I'm like riding on this nice little buzz. But anyway, I gave this dude a 10 milligram edible. Mind you, the cruise was started on [00:30:00] Friday ends on

**Mike:** Sunday.

**Darrell:** Sunday,

**Mark:** a nice three dayer. Okay.

**Darrell:** Sunday morning. little three dayer, right? I gave it to him the minute we saw each other on the cruise. We boarded the ship. I gave him one and said, here, pop this right now. I'm on it. You need to be on it.

**Darrell:** Mike's on

**Mark:** Yes.

**Darrell:** we're already riding,

**Mark:** Yes

**Darrell:** You need to catch up. And he said, tick, don't half it. Tick the full ten. took that and by Friday night, he was struggling To be normal. And he did the quote that what he told me word for word was, I'm not used, I haven't, I've taken edibles, but. I've never experienced this this type, this, I've never had this experience from an edible and he

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** he did everything. He did, on top of cannabis,

**Mark:** he did other confections, right? We'll leave it at that. Yeah, we can leave it at that.

**Darrell:** leave it at that. But he had this little 10 milligram took him out for the whole weekend. And [00:31:00] literally like Saturday, he was like, I didn't, we didn't see him in the morning because he said that he was trying to, he was trying to gather himself in the room because he

**Mark:** And see, that's the thing, because you guys know, to tie it in with my experience, when I wake up in the morning I still feel baked. Slightly. Just slightly. It's like less than 10 percent baked. Whereas the previous night, I'm like at 150 percent baked. You know what I'm saying? So it's just like when you're doing that on a daily basis, it's it you I don't know how to say this, but you get into a slow state, not a steady state.

**Mark:** And I can't do that. I don't do that in the morning. Cause if I'm in a slow state, then my day is not going to be correct. Kind of thing. It's not saying it's bad. It's not bad by the way. It's just it's not at the speed that I want it to be,

**Darrell:** harder to, yeah, I get it because when you, I'm the same way. I went in, if I smoked the night before that morning, I have trouble

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** back up to

**Mark:** Yeah, so [00:32:00] it's like you got to find that sweet spot the night prior where you're there and then when you come back in the morning

**Mark:** There.

**Darrell:** I think your solution is just not to not smoke joints the size of my forearm

**Mark:** So I try i've been trying to dial back Okay,

**Darrell:** a humble, maybe a pinky size one.

**Darrell:** I don't know, man. I like you eat these things for

**Mark:** this is again. Like I said, this is just a test run and I only bought like 30 worth of cbd products you know that's gonna evaporate at some point a lot more quickly than an ounce of flower. So You know, so don't worry about it. Stay tuned for this compare and contrast Maybe that's the next episode if we do is a compare and contrast and we really hit that one hard in the head But yeah, I just wanted to share that out there that in this cannabis related world We're living in that, I recommend it.

**Mark:** It's one of those STIIIZY pods or whatever the heck you call them And it's the cbd version

**Darrell:** Wait, the C

**Mark:** Remember those, pens that we bought in [00:33:00] LA A long time ago.

**Darrell:** Oh! you got a pen, a CBD pen?

**Mark:** do you why is that bad

**Darrell:** michael.

**Mark:** Oh, you're on mute. He's angry and he's muted.

**Mike:** Sorry.

**Darrell:** a chance to gather his

**Mike:** I'm going to the five

**Mark:** Oh no,

**Mike:** right now because my hero has fallen. My

**Mark:** I,

**Mike:** has

**Mark:** I'm gonna come back.

**Darrell:** Why have you fors Why have you forsaken me,

**Mark:** This world is a lie. It's a lie.

**Mike:** It was Willie Nelson, Snoop Dogg

**Mark:** Where the hell am I on that totem pole now?

**Mike:** My

**Mark:** Fuck, I'm on a fucking stick now. Shit. Look, it was only 30 worth of product, and then once it's gone, I'm going back. I'm going back fishing. I promise.

**Mike:** If you run into Snoop, if you run into

**Mark:** Ah, fuck.

**Mike:** say, at the mall or

**Mark:** Okay. Wait.

**Mike:** the parking lot, right?

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** hanging out, he's smoking and he, you go [00:34:00] up to him and he's yo, what's up, homie?

**Mark:** You know he is gonna say, what's up, nephew? Yeah.

**Mike:** to smoke? Let

**Mike:** like to smoke? Are you gonna tell him CBD?

**Darrell:** you have, do you have a CBD?

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** Oh, and

**Mark:** What is this?

**Darrell:** read stories. You cannot cough around Snoop.

**Mark:** Let me,

**Darrell:** cough the same with yeah, you cannot cough around Snoop.

**Mike:** hero has fallen.

**Darrell:** have his guard, his

**Mark:** what did I buy? Thanks. What

**Mike:** This is not a happy hour, Mark. This is

**Mark:** did I buy? Wanna tell you what I bought.

**Darrell:** CBD

**Mark:** Melon,

**Mike:** Smoking it!

**Darrell:** It's like you couldn't even take the oil. You had to take the vape

**Darrell:** The

**Mark:** Juicy

**Darrell:** the

**Mark:** It's a, it's called Juicy Melon.

**Mike:** in,

**Mark:** It's Juicy Melon Pods. These are Juicy Melon. That's what it's called. It's the Juicy Melon STIIIZY Pod.

**Mike:** So you're doing, so you're not even smoking CBD. You're not putting CBD in a joint. It's

**Mark:** it's one of those vape pods that you plug into those [00:35:00] USB pens that we got. No!

**Darrell:** Oh no, it's the heat. The

**Mark:** No!

**Mike:** the

**Darrell:** It's

**Mark:** I back? Am I back?

**Darrell:** There you go. Don't move.

**Mark:** I'm good?

**Mark:** No, it is not even flower. It is the little STIIIZY vape pods or whatever they want those cartridges.

**Darrell:** Do they even have,

**Mark:** Yes, they make them because I ordered them

**Darrell:** maybe a stupid

**Mark:** from a licensed retailer

**Darrell:** Is there

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** Okay, what is that? What is CBD flower?

**Mark:** See flower is

**Mike:** It's hemp,

**Mark:** And it's male and female.

**Darrell:** is it like

**Mark:** No

**Darrell:** Bark? Or I don't even

**Mark:** No, it's hemp. It's hemp based though.

**Darrell:** it is! It's

**Mark:** Let me google that for you. Someone google that for me Yeah,

**Mike:** hemp

**Mark:** so remember it's the cousin, like you're dealing with the cousins of cannabis.

**Darrell:** several hemp shirts. Can

**Mark:** I don't think you, those fibers aren't going to do anything for you. You need a little something closer to the leaf,

**Darrell:** It's

**Mark:** not any of those stalks.

**Darrell:** right? There's probably nothing left in [00:36:00] there.

**Mark:** See,

**Darrell:** Ah,

**Mark:** cousin of cannabis, there you go. So remember hemp is like a combination of, cannabis is like strictly the female flower too. With hemp it's a combination of both, so it's like they don't discriminate. Okay. Okay. That's part of it.

**Darrell:** okay. Now what's the the term here? Are you just going to go until you

**Mark:** Yeah, I'm not gonna buy more. This was just a test run. This was a test run

**Darrell:** okay. And then I know you mentioned it already, but I just want to make sure we're clear. What's the reason why you see you

**Mark:** because I felt too stoned the next morning

**Mark:** And you guys already know that I'm not gonna forfeit and go with your suggestion and smoke a pinky worth of a joint. I'm gonna smoke a fucking forearm joint. That's how I am. It's either win or go home.

**Darrell:** Nah,

**Mark:** So I had to cut back at it.

**Darrell:** sounds like a skill issue.

**Mike:** Skill issue.

**Darrell:** Skill issue here.

**Mark:** Look so

**Mike:** It's a

**Mark:** part of it is too you guys know this [00:37:00] i've said this in many podcasts, prior to this

**Darrell:** Yeah

**Mark:** no, but

**Darrell:** relate. I can

**Mark:** Thank you, but like I also tell you guys this too. I'm Fully transparent with my doctor that I visit year over year now that we're over 40 and I tell them hey, yeah I smoke weed every day. My risky behaviors are Brazilian jiu jitsu.

**Mark:** Thanks Darrell. So it's like my body is going to be compromised someday and I smoke cannabis Those are my two things doc. You figure it out. That's those are going to be my consistent

**Darrell:** You can't

**Mark:** Yeah, these are going to be my consistent behaviors I show you year over year. You figure it out. You decided to be the doctor.

**Mark:** I decided to be your patient. So go ahead, write a medical study on me if you want. I don't care. You know what I mean?

**Darrell:** The most he can do is just give you his

**Mark:** And that's the fucked up part because

**Darrell:** or

**Mark:** the medical community is so Blue balled by this too, from this federal illegalization.

**Darrell:** You'd think they'd be

**Mark:** They are!

**Darrell:** because of

**Mark:** They sincerely are, in terms of wanting to [00:38:00] pursue studies and stuff like that, but those are limited because of regulation.

**Mark:** They are! You'd be at peace with that.

**Darrell:** I mean it's it could cannabis could be Yeah, cannabis could be just as lucrative as

**Mark:** that's the problem too, that's the business.

**Darrell:** It's there. I think it's just It's I think it's like the and there's cannabis has so many enemies right now They got that tobacco industry after them

**Mark:** Alcohol, alcohol industry alcohol industries are buying cannabis companies,

**Darrell:** you

**Mark:** It's, that's the truth. Google it. It's out there. Big money is buying it up.

**Darrell:** and then within the cannabis group of supporters.

**Darrell:** Each other,

**Mark:** So a fun one that you showed me not too long ago in the last week or so, I really did dig dive deep and watch that CNN special edition on black Market cannabis. In suburbia in California.

**Mark:** That was a good one. That was a good one So if anyone wants to check that out what's going on is that they're taking Houses that are as big as Mike's home [00:39:00] right there or as big as your home and they turn them into grow facilities Mike.

**Mark:** Oh, yeah, three thousand two thousand and three thousand square foot homes that are retrofitted incognito style to be grow rooms indoor grow rooms. Can you imagine?

**Mike:** crazy.

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** is low It's like a slap on the wrist and the amount

**Mark:** The end

**Darrell:** They make Even after they get

**Mark:** Imagine you're an underground group,

**Darrell:** is enough

**Mark:** and it's only a misdemeanor, a slap in the wrist. So the revenue minus cost, the cost is so low, you're profiting and you're not paying any tax.

**Mark:** You wonder why the shit exists, it's a misdemeanor. It's if it's, they're going to continue to do it. And here's the thing, what I found most interesting about that story though,

**Mark:** The fact that when they got in trouble, the house got seized, They took apart all the infrastructure. Dude, Mike, have you not watched that one yet?

**Mark:** You should. It's like only 10 minutes long. It's only, it's a it's worth your 10 minutes. So they'll gut your entire, like these [00:40:00] guys and gals, they gut your entire house. So it doesn't even look like a house anymore on the inside.

**Darrell:** and they literally rec,

**Mark:** Yeah. They put

**Darrell:** A grow warehouse.

**Mark:** they cut holes in different areas of the home for sprinklers and irrigation systems and ventilation systems.

**Mark:** It doesn't look like a house on the inside. On the outside, perfect. Yeah.

**Darrell:** I'm impressed.

**Mark:** I can't hate. I was impressed. Yeah.

**Darrell:** I'm impressed. It was, yeah. Yeah, it was pretty impressive. I was like, dude and this is throughout our state it's just only in our state, actually. So it's just throughout

**Mark:** And it's crazy cause

**Darrell:** And think

**Mark:** You're not gonna get arrested. You're just gonna get a ticket. Or it's a misdemeanor. What the fuck?

**Darrell:** it's

**Mark:** exactly. And then, so it's like it's crazy. It's the most insightful 10 minutes of cannabis news I've seen in quite a while more so than anything else since

**Darrell:** Do you remember how old that, that piece

**Mark:** how old

**Darrell:** I forget. Was [00:41:00] it

**Mark:** it was definitely this year It was a modern it's a modern day. It's a 2024 article

**Darrell:** it's still happening.

**Mark:** Yeah, because

**Darrell:** yeah. It's

**Mark:** in that the authority said, we've only caught so many homes, like 50 homes, but they guesstimate or estimate that there are 200, at least over two.

**Mark:** Yeah, over Bay Area

**Darrell:** That's in your, up in San Jose,

**Mark:** two. They guesstimate that they're trying to track that.

**Mark:** There are probably 200 plus single family homes out there that are incognito, grow rooms. Simply, there aren't families living in there at all

**Darrell:** let me put a spin on this. Let me put a spin on this. How good do you think that weed is?

**Mark:** real good. It's indoor. It's indoor you have complete control

**Darrell:** Yeah, but,

**Mark:** What do you mean by good what does good mean in this case

**Darrell:** Do you quality? Because they're churning for quantity.

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** They have they're looking at, they're looking at a

**Mark:** and they're shipping all of this stuff out of state So

**Darrell:** so

**Mark:** I would say quality probably isn't there because after cultivating it [00:42:00] how they curate it i'm sure they're probably doing it really fast and then shipping out shipping it out of state

**Darrell:** yeah, you're

**Darrell:** Yeah, granted they go through the

**Darrell:** Process, but trying to out quality. So you sacrifice quantity. Sorry. They're trying to turn out quantity. So

**Mark:** it's one of those things, right? It's one of the other it's opportunity costs It's like what if you pull on one lever something else is gonna push right? Yeah

**Darrell:** He's

**Mark:** I will go I will I gravitate to less quality, but still good enough. How's that? Does that land?

**Darrell:** maybe yeah,

**Mike:** Cause you could you could dedicate say for instance, to 200 houses, you could dedicate 50 of those to, you know, high quality

**Mark:** That's true.

**Mike:** like the good bud that you could buy, the 60 an eighth bud, that could be that. And then the 150 houses, let's pump out that

**Mark:** Dang.

**Mike:** that

**Mike:** Let's

**Mark:** that it bothers me that you said an eighth is 60 because when I was doing this It was like 40 to 45 for an eighth on the street

**Mike:** You can find, yeah there's brands that [00:43:00] have a six, 60 for an eighth. That's I know I can't personally tell.

**Darrell:** yeah, the results,

**Mike:** it's

**Darrell:** I tried to see if I could distinguish, but to me, man, I think my senses are so numb, it's just, weed is

**Mark:** it?

**Darrell:** And it takes me there faster sometimes, not as fast, but I get to where I need to

**Mark:** Lately I would agree to that.

**Darrell:** My, my thing too yeah, I just, I think just because of where we're at our age I've spent, I've done some, some, don't want to say research, but

**Mark:** That is research, by the way. That's research, trial and error. Trial and error is research. Don't discount yourself for saying that.

**Darrell:** Yes, you're right. I've done research on expensive weed let's see, what is it think it was, what is it, the Marathon? Marathon, that was like 60 bucks for right? Versus some Grizzly Peak stuff that's 30, like half

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** I couldn't tell the difference.

**Darrell:** It got me to where I

**Mark:** There's one product I really like.

**Darrell:** I think if anything.

**Mark:** Oh, I'm sorry. Go, I interrupted you.

**Darrell:** Oh, no, that's

**Mark:** There is

**Darrell:** trying. That's

**Mark:** one,

**Darrell:** point I was trying to make is that I

**Mark:** I can discern with [00:44:00] one, and you introduced it to me one time, and I think it's more it likens to a blend or like a cigar like thing. Backwoods? Do you, does that ring a bell?

**Darrell:** Oh backwoods

**Mark:** game.

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** That thing is that is like I would sell that's an anniversary gift kind of thing smoking a backwood is It's like whatever.

**Mark:** It was like three and a half grams rolled up. Oh my gosh And it's like it's

**Darrell:** they're hard to find man. I can't find those as at least in our at our

**Mark:** maybe that brand no longer exists. I don't know see that's the thing about these camp. Okay

**Darrell:** No, they're still out there. They're still out there. Yeah, I can find it on Weedmaps, but excuse me, I can't, my local dispensary it's not available. And I go through my local dispensary because of convenience. They're like five

**Mark:** Are you still going to March Nash? Is that your local one night? You

**Darrell:** Ash is my spot. Yeah, not to mention they're like right across, right in front of the Costco.

**Darrell:** So the food court's right [00:45:00] there. It's this vicious cycle of okay, I got weed and then now I'm gonna go get a chicken bake and

**Mark:** what this is, Mike?

**Darrell:** ice cream.

**Darrell:** Slice of

**Mark:** is Puff Provisions, Darrell's preferred theme park. He doesn't want to go to Disneyland, he just wants to go to Costco. March Nash. Chicken Bake.

**Darrell:** March and ash And then maybe I need to fill up the gas

**Mark:** Chicken Bake.

**Darrell:** the

**Mark:** Puff.

**Darrell:** right there,

**Mark:** Dollar 50 Hot Dog. The cycle continues. The cycle continues. Gentlemen,

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** this was a great catch up.

**Mark:** I interrupted. I don't wanna, I don't wanna burn you from this. We got time. We got time. Mike, do you still wanna frown on your disappointment in me? Have I broken your heart enough tonight? Look, when

**Mike:** yeah,

**Mark:** said this is temporary. This is just CBD. It's gonna go away. I'm gonna go back.

**Mike:** It was like when Michael Jordan retired for the first time,

**Mark:** That,

**Darrell:** He

**Mark:** no. Okay, can I? Ugh. Okay. We're gonna, we're gonna.

**Darrell:** It's like

**Mark:** We're gonna end this one a little [00:46:00] more bitterly in that because we're gonna end this one without closure Which retirement hurt more Michael Jordan retirement one after? 1993 and his dad got murdered. Let's be honest. That's fucked up. That probably fucked him up or retirement number two after 98 And those guys were still fuckin dominant.

**Mark:** Because for me, 98 retirement was the one that pissed me off. Not the 93 one. That, I was, I, that I understood.

**Darrell:** That's the one where he

**Mark:** No, then he quick paused, and then he went back to the Wizards two years later. That one I was like, dude, maybe you're done.

**Darrell:** yeah.

**Mark:** with the second three peat, they were still dominant, and you couldn't prove otherwise, even though the last dance series says otherwise they, they were yeah, maybe they were tapering off in 98, but you still didn't dethrone them, and they could have kept, Jerry could have kept it,

**Darrell:** I think the

**Mark:** not for me, 98, man, when he ended it in 98, it was like,

**Darrell:** Yeah. Cause you

**Mark:** the guy was still fresh, my, MJ

**Mark:** Was fresh after [00:47:00] 98,

**Darrell:** No but he was traumatized. was traumatized. This is his, yeah, his pops was, they found his pops. And he gets murdered then the guy was traumatized and he like, through this phase of dude, he always wanted me to play baseball.

**Darrell:** And then he retired and like, The way he dropped and used on us, it was like, I'm gonna play, I'm gonna, I'm playing baseball. That's the short and sweet of it. I'm just going to play baseball because my dad wanted me to play baseball. When I heard that, I'm like,

**Mark:** Yeah, that was unexplained.

**Darrell:** Like we the bulls were like we

**Mark:** They were still good though. The 94 Bulls were good enough.

**Darrell:** They were still good they were holding their own. I mean that I don't want to get pippin, you know They had well spit

**Mark:** Horace was still on there in 94. Tony Cucco

**Darrell:** i'm

**Mark:** came in.

**Darrell:** cool coach well, he

**Mark:** so he, he wasn't out of season yet.

**Darrell:** and then

**Mark:** They basically, No, not yet.

**Darrell:** already?

**Mark:** 95 is when he got in.

**Darrell:** right? Yes. Yeah.

**Mike:** He came with

**Darrell:** Yeah, he came in anyway So yeah, I mean [00:48:00] that I think everyone got hit with that right and they're like dude.

**Darrell:** This is like You This is a, this might be like a permanent thing, right? And then we didn't know that he was going to plan a

**Mark:** That's why I,

**Darrell:** back.

**Mark:** That's why I always say, Go ahead,

**Darrell:** he,

**Mark:** you think he,

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** Yeah,

**Darrell:** had a wake up call because he's do I suck? I suck

**Mark:** you know this also shows what era of time we're from because we always look back to MJ as the source of truth or inspiration, whereas others will look the other way.

**Mike:** Old

**Darrell:** did you hear

**Mark:** No, the

**Darrell:** now?

**Mark:** hell is it?

**Darrell:** I think he's looking to purchase a formula

**Mark:** Yeah, he can do that.

**Darrell:** Team.

**Mike:** already.

**Darrell:** He has NASCAR. So I,

**Mike:** team.

**Darrell:** yeah, the one I saw was he's liking NASCAR more. And so might leave, what's the team he has? The Charlotte the Hornets.

**Mike:** sold it. He sold that

**Darrell:** He sold it. And I thought he still has shares.

**Mike:** it a couple. No, the quote was that he loves NASCAR and it can replace,

**Darrell:** That's it. That's

**Mike:** had for

**Darrell:** yeah, there it is.

**Mike:** had given it

**Mark:** How does NASCAR racing do that?

**Darrell:** And so he's loving NASCAR right now. And he has he's fully like. [00:49:00] Embrace

**Mark:** what's going to happen is that the Jumpman logo is going to be on all the cars and all the jackets and on the shoes and on the helmets.

**Darrell:** I think it, there's already

**Mark:** Dang.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** There's a hat out there. It looks sick. It looks like nasty, dude. I saw the hat he was wearing when, I'm sure Mike and I saw the same article where

**Mark:** Dang.

**Darrell:** comment. was like this black hat with something with his team on it.

**Darrell:** It was looked pretty awesome. And then, I guess there's rumors now that okay, now that he's out of the NBA, he can put bets on NBA, right? I think that was, saw something also on Reddit that he would, that's the whole reason why he wanted to move to NASCAR was

**Mark:** yep.

**Darrell:** betting man, and

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** like,

**Mike:** man.

**Darrell:** he likes to win. He

**Mark:** Dang.

**Darrell:** And so he wants to be able to bet in the NBA. And if you're no longer like, associated with it, you can bet on it. And there's no. He needs the money. I don't even, I think it's just a thrill at

**Mark:** it is because when you got all the money from the Jordan brand. You're winning, even though you're losing, you're winning more.

**Darrell:** maybe give me some [00:50:00] of that money.

**Mark:** Dad? Dad?

**Darrell:** but knowing him, he'd be like, you

**Mark:** Dude he deserved it. He worked his ass off for it, so I can't hate. And he gave good memories along the way. On that note, like I said, we're gonna end bitterly and with zero closure. The Houston Rockets are on loaner championships. Those don't, those two don't really belong to them. 94 and 95.

**Mark:** Mike, I will be back on the totem pole. at some point after this CBD clears. Darrell have fun making posters. Vote for your kid.

**Darrell:** Oh, we're done.

**Mark:** All right.

**Darrell:** I think they're,

**Mark:** And if anyone wants a mic for hire to do a wedding alongside two bud tenders, puffforvisions. com forward slash giveaway. Holla! Puff. Peace.
