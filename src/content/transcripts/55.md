[00:00:00] What's up everyone, my name is Mark. And those two over there, that's Darrell and Mike. Two of my like minded friends who I roped into having adult conversations powered by cannabis. We're simply three dads, husbands, and full time desktop athletes striving to figure out how recreational cannabis plugs into our modern day world.

Why do vape pens look like USB drives? Should I smoke it or eat it? What would my kids think? We're problem solving our way through this type of mentality on a daily basis. And we decided to capture it in audio for those of you pondering the same things. But be warned, we speculate a ton and get stuck in God's fridge quite a bit.

You can blame that on the munchies. So if you're comfy with that, come on in. Pull up a chair and kick back. And welcome to the Puff Provisions Podcast.

**Darrell:** I forget the daughter's name, but it's her

**Mark:** The friend of Girl Meets World. Hey everyone, welcome to an impromptu ad hoc after the fact episode of the Puff Provisions podcast. What are you looking up?

**Mark:** Like chair sit. You get where I'm going with that? So I was trying to do a pass. So imagine a Ninja Turtle spinning behind. And then sitting up and catching them from the back, right? So as I was [00:08:00] telegraphing that,

**Mike:** My finger is

**Darrell:** Did you,

**Mike:** in this. It's supposed to bend a little bit.

**Darrell:** did you apologize quickly? Or did you just like, what was the speed of the apology? Was it like

**Mark:** There was no,

**Darrell:** minutes

**Mark:** there was no apology. There was pretty much the clock struck. We got up.

**Darrell:** That means you just say, you signaled to your partner that you liked it. If there

**Mark:** And then we both got up and just went our separate ways. We didn't even look eyes like it didn't happen.

**Darrell:** to try to process it. He's like, was that guy kidding me?

**Darrell:** They're supposed to keep going. but

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mike:** run.

**Mark:** The irony was the bell rung.

**Darrell:** I was saying because of

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mike:** huh?

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mark:** Right. It

**Mike:** You only went first knuckle? Which

**Mark:** was like, just the first knuckle. It was up to the first knuckle. No, it was up to the first knuckle. That one.

**Mark:** Yes, it was. So it's like, how the hell does it get in there?

**Darrell:** So the fabric on the Gi's

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** So you can imagine the amount of force that came down on that thumb, right? He's probably got like on like spandex or

**Mark:** It was probably spats. It was spats. He was wearing spats. Yeah.

**Darrell:** spats.

**Mark:** little slip. Yeah. It's slippery. Yeah, exactly.

**Darrell:** well, I'm surprised. I was a [00:10:00] brick

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** or a

**Mark:** film, it was very, very traumatic, but I learned the move. So that was cool.

**Darrell:** For who? For you or for him?

**Mark:** I like it. It was good. I learned

**Darrell:** was no apology.

**Mark:** so I was cool with it. What can I say? This was a fun improv episode.

**Darrell:** like, at no time, like, at no time, I did not show you or imply that there was a step where you stick your finger in their ass.

**Mark:** Wait, if I, um, does it, does it matter what finger it was?

**Darrell:** I thought it was

**Mark:** It was, but like, would it have mattered if it was a different finger? Or is it all the same negative side? Yeah, I see. There you go. There's a nuance to it. So what happened if it was like,

**Darrell:** I mean, yeah, if he was coming down and he just went like this with the two,

**Mark:** Damn, you, you, you jumped levels on me already. I was gonna go like one finger at a time, and you're already shoving two in? Damn.

**Darrell:** can't do this. This is unpractical. This will break right? So you need a support,

**Mark:** [00:11:00] Yeah, that's true.

**Mike:** That support finger.

**Darrell:** need a strut,

**Mark:** That's true, because when you're going in on entry, you're not gripping with one finger, you're gripping with your entire hand. That's true. Trying to run an offense or a defense, yeah.

**Darrell:** like what you went past like this isn't like I don't know Doesn't really hurt his feelings anymore. He just feels attacked, you know

**Mark:** Damn.

**Darrell:** Is that sort of is that sort of trauma

**Mark:** I see, so there are differences, there are nuances to it. Uh oh, are you in trouble, Mike? No,
