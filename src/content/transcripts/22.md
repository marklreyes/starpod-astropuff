**Robbie Wagner:** [00:09] Hey, guys, this is Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Since I do the exact same intro every time, I'm changing it up. But I'm still here. It's me, Robbie Wagner, with Charles W. Carpenter III. And we're just chilling. It's just us this time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:27] You know, by saying that and doing that, what you said initially is now a lie.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:31] What do you mean?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:32] I do the same intro every time, except this one, which now I don't do the same intro. I just want to point that out.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:39] I don't get it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:40] That's all right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:42] I changed it a little. I always say, like, what's up, everybody? This is another Whiskey Web and Whatnot?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:48] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:48] Like, the same thing.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:50] Something to be said for consistency. I'm wrapping a label, which get going.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:56] Yeah, this one was hard to get open at the top if that's what you were trying to do.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:02] Okay. Yeah, I just got past the plastic. You know what I think what it is, is you should have had a man helping you. Just kidding. Now it just reminds me, like, what you said in needing to give it a little more. It's one of the things that I still always have to do. What is it? Open the jars. Open jars. Open the caps to things all the time. It's a husband's job, I guess.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:29] Yeah. Sarah can get it open.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:31] All right, so today we're having Blue Run Kentucky Straight Cask Strength Rye Whiskey. 106 proof compared to, I think, their normal is a 92. The Internet has no idea what kind of mash bill it is, but we know it's.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:49] It's the holiday batch.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:50] Yeah, it's a holiday batch. It's high rye.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:54] What bottle number are you?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:56] Where do we got that? Oh, okay. Here we go. Let's see here. It was bottled on 11/4/21 and 25 48. No bottle. 23 25. Which one are you?

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:09] 23 26. So we're bottle buddies.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:13] Okay. Yeah. Oddly enough, they just grabbed two right off the shelf since we ordered about the same time. Yeah, it would make sense. So, yeah, we don't know too much else about this. It's a secret. We don't know which distillery it was bottled in, but it's in Bardstown, which makes, like, a few, like, Heaven Hill KBD is there, which is, like, Willett, essentially, who else is right in Bardstown.

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:38] So we think someone made this, and then Blue Run bottled it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:42] Exactly. That's exactly what happened. So Blue Run is, like, basically subbing out. They do a bunch of marketing, do barrel picks, and have someone else take care of the heavy lifting and aging and storage and stuff. Maybe on the offhand that they could have someone else produce it, but they provide a mash bill and stuff. Like, here's my recipe, that kind of thing. But I don't know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:07] Yeah, I'm sure the entry on Seelbach's says something about all of that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:15] Have you confirmed that you've said it correctly yet?

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:18] Yeah. Bach. Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:20] Bach. You did? Okay. Yeah. And I think in the last episode that we recorded, I was referencing that pronunciation from, like, a candy from when I was growing up, but that candy was Brrach's, not Bach's. I've been corrected by my own memory. I'm going to give a little smell while you do that. Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:**[03:41]Interesting. Yeah. It doesn't say. I found the gift set. Let me see if I can find the not-gift set.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:47] A little black pepper on the smell and first taste. What was it they called that when you prime your palate or something, the first drink, it's supposed to get all the saliva to the surface, so you keep it in your mouth a little longer?

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:05] Yeah. Just coating your tongue. Right. Or chewing your whiskey.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:08] Chewing your whiskey. I like that. All right. So I chewed a little, and I get a little black pepper from that chew. So let's see if it changes. Get a little, like, dried apricot and something like musty at the finish for me. I don't know. Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:30] Yeah, it's a little musty. Trying to get those first flavor notes before that hits me, and I'm having trouble.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:38] Yeah. Now that it's made its appearance, it's a little hard to get past.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:45] I don't know. I mean, it's got a little sweetness and some kind of fruitiness, like, on the immediate hit of your tongue, but then yeah, it's really, like, spicy and black peppery and that little bit of mustiness and can't really tell you what's going on.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:00] Yeah. Something else there. It reminds me of the smell of wet leaves in the fall. Like wet, dry leaves. [inaudible 00:05:09] Yeah, that's my it's the visual that came to mind.

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:12] Yeah. I'm getting a little bit of leather on the finish. I think, too.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:15] Yeah. Maybe that's part of the bitterness.

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:17] Pretty complex.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:20] I'm not sure how I feel about it, though.

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:22] Yeah, I don't really know. I'm not educated enough to know what makes it taste certain ways, but this feels, like, rushed to me or something. Like, not aged enough. I don't know. I'm getting some what I would classify as youngness, I think.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:39] Could be some of that too, like, whatever's in the mash bill, and that's kind of coming up a little too much grain or something, which would be, like, not aged enough. Oftentimes. I wonder, too, though, some of these. I hadn't really thought about this before, but another way to well, first of all, give us some diversity in what we're reviewing, but we could come back to some also because sometimes they need a little time to open up. You come back, you give them a week or a month or something, you come back, and it changes a little bit. So maybe that is something this would benefit from because, as of right now, I'm not sure. I don't hate it. I think it's a little weird, but I'm like three, four tentacles. Like, I'm almost, like, give bumping into four because it's interesting, at least. And not just like, you know, burny and peppery or something, but like but that mustiness, whatever that thing is, is kind of turning me off about it. It's different, but it's also maybe not great.

**Robbie Wagner:** [06:40] Yeah, I kind of agree. I'm a little bit middle of the road around a four, I think, but it's disappointing because I'm fine with drinking a four. Four is okay, but it's this special holiday one that was not cheap, so I would have expected more out of it. And maybe that's why it has these weird flavors. Like maybe they thought those were interesting, and people would like those. I don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [07:05] But yeah, it is a little bit disappointing because I feel like a lot of things about it were going to be good. Bardstown distilleries it's usually pretty good stuff. Yeah, maybe it's coming through a smaller producer doing different or new stuff. Who's to say who's at fault there? But TBD on that one, I think.

**Robbie Wagner:** [07:28] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [07:29] I'm going to go with four. I feel good about that. I don't want to completely crap on people's work. Seems like there's some things that go into this, and they're not trying to basically just paint over it with maple syrup, so right. I'll say four.

**Robbie Wagner:** [07:44] Yeah, I agree. I think on branding, like seven, like this is a nice-looking bottle. I would like to see more from this distiller, like see what they've got in store other than the holiday one.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [07:58] Yeah, branding. Solid seven. On branding. It looks premium, in a way. Like it's a nice different-shaped bottle. It's got like that butterfly thing glued to it. Yeah. So I guess we just started rating on marketing or appeal. Visual appeal, then. Hey, they've got that going.

**Robbie Wagner:** [08:18] Yeah. You know what? It probably is. They didn't use the right mineral water. That's why it's got the mustiness.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [08:25] I don't know, but I mean, they're in Bardstown. They're in the heart of it. They're supposed to be getting that Kentucky limestone water.

**Robbie Wagner:** [08:32] The New York One must be better then, I guess.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [08:36] Oh, wow. Fighting words. But we can Pepsi challenge that at some point in the future.

**Robbie Wagner:** [08:43] Yeah, definitely.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [08:45] Just spilled water on myself. So apparently, half an ounce in is just too much. You're cut off. Maybe we should move on to tech. So solid. We're going to go four tentacles for me.

**Robbie Wagner:** [08:56] Yup, same for me.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [08:58] Alright, four tentacles it is.

**Robbie Wagner:** [09:00] Yeah. I mean, for tech, I mean, this whole thing is just thrown together. But like this stuff I've been working on recently, I've been spending a lot of time with Embroider and Ember 4 over the past. I don't even know how many months. It feels like a year, but I think it's only been three to six months, maybe. And it's been really not fun because, basically, Ember wants to move the core framework along. So they're working on releasing it, and then Embroider is the new build tool which uses webpack behind the scenes and ultimately solves a lot of problems. But dropping them and making them the defaults breaks every add-on that exists. So you can't just release the new version of the framework if everyone building apps is stuck. Right. So I've been spending all this time trying to update everything, and finally, I've been working directly with Ed Faulkner from the Core Team and getting like liquid fire, liquid wormhole, liquid tether, liquid everything, working with everything. That's been fun.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:12] You're supposed to turn it all into a card stack app, and it'll be fine.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:16] I don't know if that's how it works, but.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:20] I have no idea how it works either. Maybe we should have Ed on here sometime, and he can explain it for us a little bit.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:26] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [10:27] I know that it's integrated blockchain now, and so it's Web3, maybe like a De app kind of thing or something like that now, which is also very confusing to me. So happy to get someone else on in the space talking about building apps in that way.

**Robbie Wagner:** [10:43] Yeah, I remember talking to people that were working there, and they could explain it enough to be like, okay, I kind of know what I'm working on. Kind of how it works. But yeah, everyone is very relatable to Web3 in general, where it's like it's new. No one knows how it works except for the people that made it. Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:03] Right. And then for them, it's like an echo chamber of like it totally makes sense. That's why it came out of my brain.

**Robbie Wagner:** [11:13] But in non-Ember news, the new hotness that you've mentioned a little bit is Astro. I guess it's not Astro js. It's like Astro.build because.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:28] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [11:29] It's somehow I don't really know the story. I've just heard of it. So started playing with it and did not educate myself. But I think it's affiliated with Snowpack and the people that did that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:40] Okay, yeah, I kind of always forget now because there's all these new things sort of popping up, and they do have correlating sub-libraries or something. I wasn't sure if it was Snowpack or Vite. Isn't Vite another, like, build utilities kind of thing?

**Robbie Wagner:** [11:58] Yeah, I think it actually does use Vite under the hood, but I believe the that it at least was under at one point was like Snowpack or something. It was like an experiment that came out of the Snowpack Team. Hey, don't quote me on that because I could be 100% wrong.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [12:19] Well, it's going to be on the Internet, so it's pretty much over. You're quoted. Yeah, I wonder Astro. I mean, they have just called Astro Technology Company. I'm just looking up some information on the Internet. Yeah, just with Astro. So I'm not sure, or maybe I got it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:37] Hold on. So there's with Astro/Snowpack. Maybe I got it backwards. The Astro Team made Snowpack. And then I guess realized they liked Vite better.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [12:52] Could completely be that as well. So hard to say. But then Vite versus SWC, then I mean, are those are different, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [13:02] Yeah, I don't really know what all the different things do. There's a whole bunch of things in the same category, but I don't really even know the definition of that category. It's kind of like it speeds up your builds. Right. But it's like, I think, also for making the smallest builds you can, at least in the case of Astro, it's more about doing things at build time and basically deleting all of your JavaScript so that you just ship HTML. If you had a for loop in your template or, I guess, in React land, you would map it, but whatever, you're going over values and displaying a bunch of list values or something. So it would ship just all of those values as LI's instead of actually executing the JavaScript and generating them. It would just do all that first and then ship all the generated stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [13:57] Yeah. So essentially, it's a static site generator.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:01] It's like a way to get the nice things about JavaScript frameworks that you're used to from a developer experience perspective. It gives you all of that, but then you only ship like what people used to make web apps out of ten years ago. It's just like HTML and CSS, and that's it. There's no frameworks. You might use a little JavaScript if there's specific things you need to do that require JavaScript, but.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:28] Maybe like for your analytics on the page or something like that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:31] Yeah, and.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:33] Minimal interactivity.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:34] Like animations, like animating on scroll or stuff like that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:39] Interesting.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:41] I've been working on converting our website to use Astro, and at first, I was very disappointed because I spent like a couple of days converting it, and I did a side-by-side like web.dev where you can go and do this page speed thing now.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:58] Yeah, I mean, you can do Lighthouse things within dev tools locally or whatever, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:04] I think web.dev uses Lighthouse. Let me check.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [15:09] I'm glad you did your research.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:11] I just use things. Yeah, web.dev test your pages in a lab environment powered by page speed insights. So yeah, it's like similar tools, but instead of running on your machine, it's in like a controlled lab environment.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [15:25] Okay, that makes sense. Which would be like you'd have more variables there. You wouldn't be running like. Hopefully, you're not running just like a dev instance, but your production production build or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:36] And the scores were initially not great. Like they weren't bad, they were all green. We think we got like a 98 or something, but it was like 1.6 seconds. I always forget what all of the different things are. It wasn't like time to first byte because that's quick. It was like Largest Contentful Paint, I think, was 1.6 seconds. And on the Nuxt site, I think it was like 2 seconds, so different, but not hugely different.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:04] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:05] And then I realized as I was going line by line through the report, like basically the Lighthouse report that you may have seen, it was loading because I had used an Astro template, and it was loading like Google Fonts, and that was holding it up for like a second. So I deleted that, and it was much, much faster.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:25] Okay, there you go.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:26] It's probably not quite as fast as if you had literally gone through and written everything in vanilla HTML and CSS.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:32] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:32] But it's pretty damn close.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:35] Right with conveniences.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:37] Yeah. So the only complaint I have so far is there's no kind of image package which we've gotten used to with, like, Next.js Image or Nuxt Image. And those give you a nice way to say, at this screen size, use this size image, generate these different ones, like save bytes shipping smaller images on smaller devices and stuff. So you can only ship one size image. So we'll have to do just like a really big one so that it's high quality when we need it, and then we'll be shipping too many bytes. Usually, they're working on a package that does all that. So once that's out, I think it will have no downsides. If you are doing like a website, if you're doing a very JavaScript-heavy app, you probably don't want to use a thing that just pulls all the JavaScript out.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:27] Right, yeah. Not good for SaaS products, that kind of thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:31] No.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:32] Right. Which in that arena, then, aside from the regular tools that we've been mentioning, the experimentation goes into Remix and RedwoodJS, so it'd be very interesting to see what would be possible there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:51] Yeah, I think remix could be nice. Not that Redwood won't be nice, but I think Redwood is built to be like batteries included type of framework. So it's probably going to be pretty big and heavy.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:03] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:03] So I think for static sites, it's probably not the best choice, but.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:06] No, not at all.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:08] I would like to compare it to Ember for a dashboard-type app or something and see how that goes.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:15] Exactly. Especially the whole ability to have kind of a full-stack application there. So in the way that Next provides some of that by essentially allowing you to have API routes. So then you're creating your serverless API right within your application. Use some kind of ORM to get your database get your data. Boom. All set.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:38] Yeah. We'll learn a lot more about Next here in a couple of weeks. Stay tuned for that, folks.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:47] Yeah. Teaser.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:49] Teaser alert. I don't know. I mean, that's kind of a synopsis of the tech things I've been working on recently. What have you been working on?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:57] Next JS things, and actually a lot today, just working on GraphQL in general. It's not a new project, so I had nothing to do with the architecture of it, but it's using all things, Apollo. And then plus plus a couple of layers, such as, like data loaders, which is not a pattern I'm particularly fond of because it seems to create a little bit of bloat, and you end up declaring schema, and you have to create models, and then you have data loaders around those models, and it feels a bit redundant to me. So from a maintenance perspective, there's a whole bunch of extra stuff there. Personally, I'd really like to check out some other big players in the space. It seems like every time I get involved in a GraphQL project, they've already put the bets down on Apollo and Apollo Studio and things like that, which Apollo Studio gives you some excellent metrics and traces into what's going on and where things are slow and even down to the resolvers for each individual key things like that and some interesting cache stuff. But at the end of the day, you've really bought into their way and their ecosystem, which is, I'm sure, very intentional. But I've been curious about other things, things around Helios, GraphQL, and The Guild has done a whole bunch of stuff this past year, and they have their version, I think it's called The Hive, which is essentially an open source version of Apollo Studio like metrics dashboards and doesn't cost $8 billion. So that is very interesting. Yeah, I just haven't had a lot of opportunities. I should just build an internal API for us to use on Swatch, and then maybe we have our admin dashboard to manage things or see metrics from users, that kind of thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [20:50] Yeah, I mean, you're tying everything together here, but my first question was going to be because you started your spiel with, like, I had nothing to do with this architecture. We're using Apollo, so it's going to say, like, well, do you not like Apollo?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [21:05] Not really, no. There's some things there that I have not been a fan of their way, so I would like to explore other options. Is this just the way? Not from what I've seen. I mean, there is a number of ways to kind of skin this cat, too, in terms of how you put the schema together. They're doing like a pseudo schema stitching thing instead of Apollo's Federation. So that is somewhat maybe better, not as much, I'm not sure. So from a schema perspective, it's very verbose. And some of the other things they do around Caching I think, could get, I don't know, just more options, I guess. I just would like some more options in the toolbox.

**Robbie Wagner:** [21:47] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:**[21:48] I think that's where I'm going with it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [21:49] Yeah, I think I could be 100% wrong in what I'm about to say, but the way that I, as an outsider, kind of see it, and just from hearing on other podcasts how they've dealt with GraphQL and stuff, it seems similar to Ember Data ish where it's like, we're going to include everything you need, and there's half the stuff you might not use, and you might not like the way, like, Runspired was saying where they have, like if your API is actually JSON API, you could just delete the serializer because it's doing a lot of extra work. I think there's similar things in Apollo where it's like you may actually only need to just get the vanilla responses back and forth like you're doing 100% compliant GraphQL stuff, and you don't need all this extra sugar. And you could delete I forget who was saying it on. It might have been on the syntax podcast with Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. I think it was maybe one of them. It was either that or ShopTalk with Chris Coyier. And I'm blanking on who the other guy is on there.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [22:56] And the other guy, sorry, other guy.

**Robbie Wagner:** [22:59] I'm sure he's just as important, but I don't remember his name right now. But one of them was saying, like, they were shipping Apollo, and it was such a huge package, and they weren't using anything, and they just basically wrote their own thing that was like, hey, here's GraphQL, give it to me, and I'll give it to you. And we'll just use the. I think it was like a 40-line thing they said they wrote.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [23:20] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [23:20] And it just works.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [23:22] You can kind of patch together your own, like, using things like envelope, and I'm trying to remember again since I haven't really been able to use them, I'm not overly familiar, but there's ways to sort of patch together what you need. And I think you're probably not far off base there, but I think we should put a pin in that conversation because when we have Charles and Taras on, I think that is a good time to dive into questions and the guts of what's going on in those packages.

**Robbie Wagner:** [23:55] Okay, fair enough.

**Chuck Carpenter:**[23:57] Fair enough.

**Robbie Wagner:** [24:00] Yeah. Do we have any other tech topics?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [24:03] Tech? I mean, tech is such a wide berth of things. I'm continuing to try and figure out what Web3 things are, but not in a way where I can have a meaningful conversation around, or I need to just make again. It comes back to the same thing. Like, I need to try and make something, and then when I make something, then I'll probably have a better grounding on how to talk about it or how to even ask smart questions about it. Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [24:32] Well, this wasn't on my list of things to talk about, but I have a thing that somewhat straddles both tech and whatnot. Have you heard of the Playdate?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [24:42] Only in real life. My daughter had a play date yesterday.

**Robbie Wagner:** [24:46] Yeah, it's this little thing that looks like a Game Boy kind of, and it has, like, the D-pad, a couple of buttons, and a crank. And I always thought when I saw it initially, the crank was, like, to charge it or something, but the crank is actually a thing you can use in games. I don't know. Maybe the obvious one is like a phishing game or something, I guess, if you were reeling it in. But their whole thing is you can code your own games and stuff, so they have over-the-air updates, I think, where monthly you get a new game, but you can also make as many of your own as you want and stuff. So I don't know a ton about it, but I preordered it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [25:27] Okay. You would recommend thus far? Yeah. So like hackery things that you can get into. Yeah, I always want to do more Raspberry Pi projects. I'm interested in Arduino things, creating my own switches, and that kind of stuff. But time always ends up being pretty challenging there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [25:48] Yeah, time is a funny thing.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [25:51] Yeah. I had home assistant deployed for a little while in my house. But I was trying to use Z-Wave connectivity, and based on the L shape of my house and where I wanted to put some of these sensors and stuff, it was not great. And it was always going offline, and then you have to reboot or do some updates, or I just found the maintenance not to be that exciting. And then things that just don't just work. It's kind of like I used to build my own computers, and then I discovered Apple, and it just worked and didn't have constant security updates and stuff like that. And so I was just like, Well, I mean, why would I do that now? Why would I spend extra hours every week just making my computer work? Never look back.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:37] Yeah, I used to do crazy stuff like yeah, I would definitely build computers because you can't really install OSX on a built computer unless you really specifically pick out your parts for a Hackintosh. It would usually be windows. Or I would do like a Linux distro on it. And I used to love doing stupid shit like installing Arch Linux that has no user interface by default, so you have to use all command line and install all these things. I don't know, that used to be fun to me, and I was just like, why would you ever do that? That takes so much time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:15] You want a DOS throwback, I guess, I don't know. Yeah, my first computer ever was like a little Atari computer with actual floppy disks that you plug into a TV. It didn't have a monitor, just use the TV. I don't know. I played a bunch of those, like word adventure games. Like Zork. You're in a dark hallway. You have an envelope in your hand, that kind of thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [27:38] I thought Zork had graphics.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:41] No, not the ones that I played. Maybe they came out with versions later that were graphical, but this was definitely like I had a couple of different Zork ones or two or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [27:52] Let's see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:52] I remember a long time ago discovering a website where you could basically use the website, like one of those old computers, all command prompt stuff. I think it was called like Telnet or something. I don't know, I don't remember. But then you could play Zork on there. Yeah, I should have bookmarked that one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [28:11] Zork with graphics. Let's see. Graphical Remakes.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [28:14] Zork without graphics. When's Zork coming back? So we're on a gaming theme right now. So I have Stadia. I don't know if you ever tried that, the Google Stadia.

**Robbie Wagner:** [28:25] I have. But it requires good internet, so not for me.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [28:30] It does. Yeah, it definitely does that. So I have tried that once here at my coworking space. And good internet. I mean, I'm surprised I can do this podcast here, to be honest. All kinds of connectivity issues all the time. It's just like kind of crazy. But yeah, in general, I really enjoy Stadia because it doesn't require a console. And when I got in, I bought FIFA, of course, because it's pretty much all I play. And because they spent so much on certain games, they send me a free Stadia controller and the Chromecast Ultra or whatever it was. So it had, like, Stadia built into it. So I got that for the TV. Can play it on my laptop, can play it on my iPad. So it's kind of on the go to I don't know. I have been enjoying it, but.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:16] I like the idea, but I think it's just not quite there yet. Of course, at my house, I get like nine Mbps, so it's not going to work there. But yeah, I really like the idea of I can use one controller, right? And I could use it either on a TV or on my laptop, or on a phone and just play the same games. That sounds really cool.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:40] Yeah. So one day, yeah, I enjoy that a lot. Maybe it'll be good for the coworking space. Once that's all networked up. Should have a very fast connection.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:49] Well, we have a pretty fast connection now, or at least down. We have a gig down, and then it's like twelve up or something. So it's like really slow up. But we're going to have 500 up and down very soon.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [30:00] Nice. Yeah. The only problem with having that sloven up is that part of Stadia, like the thing that's the worst about slower connections because most of it is fine here at the office, but because the controller inputs are sent out and then it has to react on the server. So if you have delays and you're up, then you're going to hit a button and expect to immediately shoot the guy or shoot the ball or whatever. And then there'll be a delay there, and then it's terrible.

**Robbie Wagner:** [30:30] Yeah, that was my experience with it, even with I tried it at my parents' house, and their Internet is okay. I think they maybe have like 50, so it should be. Enough. But even then, because all the graphics and stuff are rendered elsewhere, and I don't know, it just felt clunky. It didn't feel quite polished yet.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [30:52] Hopefully, they continue to invest in the ecosystem. I think it's pretty cool if it gets a lot of potential. It's kind of fun. It sort of kept me off my Switch for a while, although I've been on the fence about selling that for a bit. And then I kind of waited because I was curious about the new Metroid, which does look cool, but apparently not enough for me to buy it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:12] The side scroll, like old school one or.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:15] Yeah, it is still kind of scrolly, but it's new. It's I forget what it's called. It just came out like a couple of months ago.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:23] Yeah, but I mean, not like Metroid Prime, like the old, I guess, old and newer relative. Right. There was a GameCube one that was like first person, and you were running around, and it was more adventury.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:38] Yeah. So it can be a bit more.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:40] Like that, but the originals are more side scrolly. Third person.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:46] Yeah. And so this is mostly side scrolly, but then does have some particular I think it's more like animations in between. I played the demo briefly, but it's called Metroid Dread, and it looks interesting, but not enough to like fully compel me away from FIFA or VR or whatever else. Yeah, but I think I'm just hanging on by a thread for Breath of the Wild 2.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:12] Oh, yeah. I was going to say you have to have a Nintendo just for the Zelda games.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:17] Exactly 100%. So I can imagine myself playing the original again. I think it's coming out at the end of this year, too. If I remember right, it's like December 2022. Yeah, they had like an update video.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:31] Do you think it's like Christmas time, or it's like the beginning of the month?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:36] I want to say probably around Christmas time. I think it's like as long as possible. Basically, it'll help their next wave of purchases. And since they've had supply chain issues, too, right? They're not going to rush and push it out now when you can't get the system, but yeah, so I'm hanging on for that. Looking forward to that. I have been taking a VR break because it is hazardous to one's health. I guess I will do the public reveal on that. I mentioned briefly to Ravi a couple of weeks ago or so. I was playing VR with my brother. Sometimes we would jump on and do parties in like Rec Room or Echo VR, which is kind of like some weird futuristic disk-throwing flying game with teams. So it can be kind of fun. And I got my just due on periodically making fun of him. When I would hear on his end, he jumps up and hits his hand on like a ceiling fan or runs into a wall or whatever. And I'm like, ha, silly you. And I set up my Guardian in a decent-sized space. But what I learned is that if you set up the Guardian all the way to the edge of obstacles and then run in that direction, you don't have enough time to see the red and stop.

**Robbie Wagner:** [33:54] Right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [33:54] So we were playing Rec Room, playing, like, some disc golf. And then later we were playing this no gravity racket, ball-like thing, and we started to actually get the hang of it. And we following back and forth, and so you're moving really fast. And then one was required a bit of a lunge, and I ran into this shelf desky thing that we have in our bedroom. So it has like three different shelves, but they're at different lengths because it's kind of leaning on the wall and smashed my face on one part hit me in the stomach, and then the biggest part hit me right in the thigh. And I still have this massive bruise. Today. I just had to reassess for a little while. I was like, okay, I'd hurt a bunch. I'm going to take a little break here. And I'm just going to get back to FIFA and sitting on my butt.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:45] Yeah, that's how I do VR is I do the sitting one, but I feel like it feels weird. You get more of the disorientation because you're not moving the direction that things are moving.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:00] Yeah. So your body isn't assimilating in any way if you're not. I try to walk and move as much as I can. I've seen videos where people are doing them in large spaces, like a gymnasium or something. And that would be pretty cool. You just have so much space.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:14] Don't they make, like, treadmills? I've heard that you can continuously walk and move forward in the game and stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:21] Yeah, I've heard that. And so it kind of gets triggered on when you start moving or something. That might be excessive for me and my gaming needs because it's always like time allows, like, a handful of things on minimal repeat once or twice a week.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:36] I don't think that stuff will ever take off until we get to the point where people literally aren't taking the goggles off ever. Right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:44] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:44] Because then you've got to move around some. So you'll do like this immersive actual walk-around thing. But yeah, I mean, right now, video games are how can I just lay down and not do much?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:58] That essentially amounts to TV shows for me. I started watching The Peacemaker. I don't know if you hadn't seen the Suicide Squad film. No. John Cena plays the character Peacemaker, which is kind of an ironic name for how his character ends up acting but not realizing that he's not so into peace and is, like, very violent. And then there's this campy spin-off TV show now on HBO, Max. Highly recommended.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:26] Is it still John Cena?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:28] It's still John Cena.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:30] Say no more.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:31] Yeah, okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:33] I like John Cena. He's a funny guy.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:35] You don't even really need to bother with the movie if you don't want to. You can get right into it, and it is very entertaining.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:42] Okay. Yeah, I'll check it out. I'm going to get the John Cena theme song for the episode SmackDown next week. I'm going to have an intro that's like in the red corner and introduce everybody. It's going to be good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:01] Have you coached our guests? And that we are going to be setting it up in this way. I was going to go more of the debate way.

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:09] No, it's more fun if you don't.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:12] Okay. I was going to go more of the debate way, like where Navy Blazer and very Ivy League kind of set up and say the question and set it up more like a debate.

**Robbie Wagner:** [37:23] Well, I think the actual content should be more debate-like, but just the fact that I've already named it the WWW SmackDown. I'm going all in on the intro on that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:34] Yeah, I mean, if you need any props or assistance, feel free to reach out to my brother. He is a 37-year-old man who is still very obsessed with wrestling, attending events, watching things. Certain it hasn't hindered his dating life. And I will let him know that I said these things on a podcast that somebody listens to. As far as I know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:00] We're at like 200-300 ish people listening right now.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:04] That seems reasonable.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:05] Yeah, I don't think that we are interesting enough for like 10,000 people to listen to. So I'm happy with two to 300.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:12] Speak for yourself. Speak for yourself. Have you seen these flat caps?

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:17] True. When's the new Peaky Blinders season coming out? That's the real question.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:21] That's an excellent question. I have no idea. And the thing is that when the next seasons come out because I basically need a warm-up before I start diving into a bunch of those episodes because it takes me probably one or two episodes worth to get back into the swing where I understand what they're saying because their accents are so deep. And so I go back, and we'll watch one or two old ones first so that I can be like, okay, because I know what's happening. And then I can, like, all right, yeah, now I got it. Now I can do new stuff. Otherwise, I'll just be lost for one or two episodes of new stuff.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:59] Yeah. When I started, like, the first couple of episodes, I just threw subtitles on so that I could read and learn what they were saying.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [39:07] Yeah, that makes sense, too. I probably would simplify things, but they have so much time in between seasons. It's a lot of good TV.

**Robbie Wagner:** [39:17] I think the current or the new one, whenever it comes out, has been delayed for like a year or two from COVID stuff, I think.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [39:25] Right, Peaky Blinders season six release date. Let's see what it says. I mean, two days ago, it says, I don't think they know. I know that Ozark's next season is coming soon.

**Robbie Wagner:** [39:38] So I think they did this with Breaking Bad back in the day. They released, I don't know, eight episodes, and then six months later, they released like six more. Is it going to be like that, or are they going to try to make two full seasons out of the last quote-unquote season?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [39:54] Probably because that's exactly what Game of Thrones did. Yeah, right. They would split it up between the beginning and the end of the year, really try and lure you in, so I can see that, especially on your last season.

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:07] It kind of makes no sense on Netflix, right? There's no ads. There's no reason to keep me around longer, right? Unless you're wanting me to watch other stuff while I'm waiting for the second half to come out. I guess.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [40:19] Perhaps, yeah, like if you've paused Netflix or if you've been diving into another platform for a while. I'm not that savvy on things. I never spend a bunch of time on Netflix. Okay, now I'm going to pause this subscription while I do HBO Max for two months or something like that. I'm not. I'm not that savvy. I don't manage them all. So, unfortunately, we just, yeah, have them all.

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:43] I just pay for all of them and lose lots of money, basically. Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [40:47] The only thing that I sort of trade logins on are associated with soccer. So, like, I have Peacock, you have CBS Sports, and someone else has, like, ESPN Plus, and everything is switched out depending on the competitions. And then we'll all trade for that stuff.

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:03] But sports are weird. I pretty much only watch college sports, and they'll do a blackout in the area, and they'll be like, okay, you have to have this channel to watch it. Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [41:15] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:15] Okay, cool. I'm fine with that as long as you allow me to buy that channel. Right. But there's no way I can get that channel online or on Dish or on, like, anything which sounds wrong. Like, if you want to do that, you should have a streaming app or something that's like, okay, it's blacked out, but you can stream it directly from us for like $5.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [41:35] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:36] I would do that, but there's like, no, can't watch it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [41:39] I think lots of people do that. Yeah, I think there's a bunch of legalities in terms of purchasing rights to certain things that close off that option, but it seems really dumb. Don't close it off to me if I want to consume, and this is how all those pirated sites end up popping up.

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:58] Oh, yeah, I go to streamgamesonline.com.co.uk.fake.virus.net, and I still can't stream it. It still doesn't work.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:07] Oh, bummer.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:08] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:09] There was a time for European soccer competitions that I had to rely on that a lot. Just because there weren't a lot of rights here and then, it would still be blocked off, and yeah, I didn't have an outlet. So one of these crazy sites, you just keep clicking, keep clicking, keep clicking links until you found one that actually worked. And then you'd have like 50 ads all over it. And being the smart developer, I could go in there and delete all those divs and then try to watch the show. But it was just such a pain, and it doesn't really make any sense for someone who just I just want to stream this thing. Let me pay you money. I guess it's about, like, who gets the money in the end.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:48] But yeah, it's all dumb. I'm definitely waiting to catch up on lots and lots of shows when I'm inevitably up all hours of the night with the new baby coming soon.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:00] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:00] Got a lot of stuff in the queue.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:02] Perfect time off from coding and time on to doing basically that. Yes. So Boba Fett, is The Book of Boba Fett on your list?

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:12] It definitely is. I was telling Katelynn because she doesn't watch any of the Star Wars shows or whatever. So yeah, I've really got to watch this Star Wars show before the next Star Wars show comes out so that I can catch up on the Star Wars show.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:25] Exactly. Yeah, because Obiwan, I don't know. That comes out this year. Yeah, there's more Mandalorian. Yeah, you've gotten. I have so many now, it's like a fantasy show so that I have to basically watch on my own. So anything Marvel pretty much watches on my own. Anything Star Wars pretty much watch on my own. And now I have some of these DC things just through HBO Max that I've started getting into. So now I have the DC Universe watching on my own.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:52] Aren't they losing the DC stuff, though?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:55] I haven't heard that, but maybe.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:59] Because Warner Media owns it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [44:00] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [44:01] And I think they were taking it back.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [44:04] I don't know. I thought all of that, like AT&T, Time Warner, all of that, because of the merger. That's why they have everything. So are they breaking off?

**Robbie Wagner:** [44:13] I don't know. Something was happening to where maybe they were doing another Warner-specific streaming or something. I don't know what was happening, but I remember reading, like, if you like this DC content, watch it soon on HBO because you're not going to get it forever.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [44:30] I have not heard that at all. I don't know. Google doesn't see anything around that. So maybe not. Hard to say for now. You can consume it all there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [44:41] I just want the Marvel stuff to come back. Like, all the shows like Daredevil and all of those were so good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [44:48] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [44:49] It was like the number three show Daredevil was I don't think it was even streaming. It was just like, of all shows. And then they were like. We're Netflix. We can't talk to Disney enough to make a deal. So we'll just cancel it?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:05] Yeah, basically. And then invest in their own stuff. Hard to say, I guess. Maybe. I don't know. But yeah, that was a pretty great show, actually. I watched all those.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:18] Luke Cage was good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:19] Yeah, enjoyed that too. Like Iron Fist or whatever was the other one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:24] Iron Fist was not as good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:26] Jessica, I didn't watch that one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:28] Jessica Jones. Yeah, that one was good.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:30] Yeah, I didn't watch that one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:32] When those were out, I had more time. Now all I watch, literally all I've watched in the last six months, is Law and Order. Because every week or so, I'll watch like an episode or two. Do you watch Law and Order at all?

**Chuck Carpenter:**[45:46] I don't. But what's funny about it is this morning, as I was going through some stuff, and I'll sometimes put on a podcast, and I was listening to the Tim Ferriss one with Sarah Silverman. And she loves TV. And he's like, what's your go-to? If like nothing else, like the tried and true. And she said, like, Law and Order. And she called it like, soft-core murder. You get like the murder mystery thing, but they don't really show blood, and nothing's too violent.

**Robbie Wagner:** [46:14] That's true. Yeah, but so Law and Order SVU is on its 23rd season, and it's been out since like 1995 or something. So it was getting boring. It was more about, like, oh, the main characters. Like, son is like having conflicts at school or, like, stupid shit. Not interesting. But then, so they brought back, I'm sure you've seen an episode or two of Law and Order SVU, right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [46:42] Yeah. At some point in my life, like, visiting my mom or something. And she would watch that stuff.

**Robbie Wagner:** [46:47] So the old school guy was Stabler, and he would just beat everyone. He'd be like, oh, you raped someone. Okay, turn off the cameras. I'm going to beat you. It was fun when he was on, right? And then he's back now with his own show, and they cross over like every episode. And SVU is like, oh, yeah, SVU is supposed to be about sex crimes. Well, actually, there's all this mob stuff, and everyone just killed each other, and there's no sex crime. So we're going to do an SVU episode anyway. It's really fun. Now, I would recommend the latest seasons to anyone that hasn't caught up.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:21] And to the layman, you say you could just jump in at any point? Oh, yeah. Just like, I don't need contacts. I just get in there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:29] No.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:30] All right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:30] No, they're all self_contained.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:32] Fair enough. It's a little nugget. Just a little nugget of anything.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:38] Yeah. So next week, we're getting our Tesla.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:44] Very nice.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:45] We were supposed to get it in April. And they emailed me last week, and we're like, hey, here's all your pick-up instructions. Whatever. But they didn't tell me I was getting it. They were just like, here's the instructions when you pick it up. And like, all right, cool. I remember that in April. And they're like, oh, no, it's now.

**Chuck Carpenter:**[48:03] Yeah. Magic. So that's exciting. Yeah. It's been a one-car household for a little while, so to come back into the twofold, well, we're going.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:12] To continue to be one because we're trading in the Range Rover for the Tesla.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:17] Okay. There you go. And then you have a broken old truck, so someday you'll be in two.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:22] You can't have two incredibly expensive cars. I mean, the truck is getting more expensive, but.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:29] Yeah, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:30] But whenever I get it back, I'm going to drive that, and Caitlin will drive the Tesla most of the time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:35] Which makes sense because you will be a father before you know it. And safety is of issue, I think, in the truck. So no baby seat in there.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:46] Yeah. I mean, Caitlin as a pregnant woman, cannot ride in the truck right now because it's too bouncy and unsafe, and then you probably don't want a newborn in something like that. So yeah, it's my getting to and from the office vehicle.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:00] I don't know. You'd be surprised. The vibrations will calm babies, and then all of a sudden, they're just sleeping the whole time.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:07] True. I mean, that runs in my jeans. My mom and I both are like, you get a car moving, and we're asleep.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:14] Interesting. I'm always the driver, so that would be dangerous.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:17] Well, I also, as I think I've told you, fell asleep driving a van and flipped it over. So I also fall asleep as the driver.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:27] As the driver, yeah. You have a history there. Any road trip? Do not recruit, Robbie.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:33] No. Unless you want to have naps every 30 minutes. I stop at exits and just nap and then go again.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:40] All right, well, you know, do you.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:44] No, Caitlin just drives because we don't want to take that long.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:48] She's like, I can't have this. Let's go. That's all right.

**Robbie Wagner:**[49:52] Yeah. I mean, I guess the last what-not thing I've been working on the coworking space is opening very soon. I guess it's been open, but we're going to announce it now that we have everything is painted. All the furniture is mostly, and we got some logos. We're feeling legit now.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:13] Right. Yeah. I mean, it's been in existence because the current tenants, there's only, like, two.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:20] Two and me.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:21] Two and you. So yeah, we don't count you. You're the janitor.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:25] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:27] So the two tenants that are there have been there. They just want a dedicated office space, but otherwise, the conversion is now open to others.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:36] Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:36] And that would be pretty exciting. Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:39] And just to keep me doing things I should be doing when this episode comes out, you guys can go to 1787. Work, and there will be a website there advertised, seeing what we have here, so if you're anywhere near the Middleburg area and want really fast internet, we got you covered.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:58] The casual Middleburg visitor who also listens to our podcast. If those things are true for you.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:06] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:06] Hop in.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:07] I mean, I don't even think Sam listens to our podcast, and he's like the one kind of tech guy in Middleburg that I know of.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:15] Who may or may not stop by and be a part of the coworking space? We'll see. If you stop by, we'll make you a special NFT which lets you try one of the whiskeys you've heard on the podcast. If we still have it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:31] Yeah. So we do need to actually probably do that. Whether it's this big NFT project or not. We should get a way that people like if you're in the Phoenix area or you're in somewhere near Middleburg, and you want to try any of these whiskeys, we have so much whiskey. Like, please come by.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:49] There it is. That's the project. Okay, so anyone who becomes a 1787 member gets an NFT so they can buy a pass. And there are, yes, there we go. Here's our this is our blockchain project. We can experiment and learn something, finally have a purpose. It's all about your special purpose. And I think I finally found it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:10] So if you have to be a member of the coworking space to be able to buy an NFT, and that NFT gives you access to the whiskey.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:18] Yes, I think something like that. Or just a member of 1787. And what we'll do is we'll have a tier that is like virtual member.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:26] Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:**[52:27] So you don't actually have to go to Middleburg and be a part of the space and pay for all the other things. It's kind of like the recur pass I think that I had shared with you, which is like, you buy this pass that is an NFT that gives you the opportunity to do other things like buy other NFTs and blah, blah. So, yeah, virtual membership and then real members will also get this NFT as their pass. Yeah, I'm working all out life.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:53] We should have a whiskey membership NFT. It doesn't necessarily have to be coordinated to the coworking space. So maybe there's like a special crossover there or something.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [53:02] So I didn't originate this idea. This is a Kevin Rose thing. So him and Tim Ferris have this random podcast episode every soft a couple of times a year. And the way that Kevin Rose explained that a way to utilize the technology is like when you're a member of a wine club, you're essentially an email on a list. And people, they accept so many. And then there are people that are on a waitlist to become a member of said wine club if somebody drops out. But it's just basically like first come, first serve. And there's no commodity to that, though. You just drop off, and then they pick up next one. But if you could have your membership as an NFT now, it's a commodity that you can say one day, okay, this is a really hot winery. Tons of people want to get into it. I can put it up auction-style. I can flat sell it, whatever else, to a specific individual willing to pay me a certain amount of money. And the way the NFTs can work is that the winery themselves could get a percentage of that sale, sell it to that person, they get the membership, and then obviously the utility is, I can buy wines, and I get whatever seasonal shipment or something like that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [54:14] Yeah, I like that. We should definitely do that for whiskeys. And if you're a holder, you'll get our new barrel pick we're going to do soon, and we'll send those out to everyone. But then, if we become, for some reason, the authority on whiskey, you should be able to sell it to someone else, right? And be like, sure, hey, these guys know their stuff. Come try their stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [54:37] They basically would be paying for our expertise in that realm. And then, yeah, I like it. Okay, I'm going to work on that. And for lack of imagination, it's the 1787 membership.

**Robbie Wagner:** [54:49] Okay.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [54:49] Home base.
