**Robbie Wagner:** [00:09] What's going on, everybody? Welcome to Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Oh, my God.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:18] Yeah, welcome.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:19] Yeah, this is Whiskey Web and whatnot with RobbieTheWagner and Charles William Carpenter the first, I think.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:27] Yes, I killed the other two, so it makes me the first now. It just changes as they pass. Okay, I got to change my entire web persona. Who's going to know who I am anymore? Welcome, everybody. Thanks for coming to this misadventure. Robbie was laughing because I was mouthing the words as he was saying them. And that would be, like, the best video snippet.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:53] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:54] Speaking of video.

**Robbie Wagner:** [00:55] If it matched up. Like, if there was no delay and I could tell that you were mouthing what I was saying, then it would have made more sense. But it just looked like you were like.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:03] Yeah, it's kind of what I was doing. Anyway, I just wanted to see if I could make you laugh in the intro. And I am successful. Offhand I know we often ask for suggestions and feedback via Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever your favorite medium of connection. Our website contact form is a really popular one. If you are sending messages in foreign languages or asking us to buy some adult-themed products, that's usually a good way to get a hold of us.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:31] Yeah. If you only speak Russian or you're selling sex toys, then go to shipshape.io and contact us.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:38] Exactly. All things aside, we have been discussing starting to publish a video as well. If you think that's a cool idea or have any feedback or suggestions around that, let us know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:49] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [01:50] Or if you're like, please, I don't want to see your faces. Let's just stick to audio. That's valid, too. Let us know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [01:56] Yeah. I'd be curious, in general, like, how many people want to see video of any podcast? Not just of us. Do you listen to podcasts actively and want to watch what we're doing, or do you just kind of put it on in the background, commuting or walking around or whatever? Because if no one wants the video, then we can save some time and money not doing it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:18] Yeah, exactly. All right, so let's talk about whiskey first. That's the first W. The first of many W's to come.

**Robbie Wagner:** [02:26] The first what?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [02:28] Today in our lowbrow series, that's not really low brow, but our less expensive series, we're going to cover a bourbon, Buffalo Trace. If you listen to the last one where we did this, we did the Sazerac Rye. So this is both from the Buffalo Trace Distillery, but it's their namesake offering. It is 90 proof. We don't know the mash bill specifically, but Buffalo Trace has four different mash bill numbers that they set up. So this is mash bill number one, which is a low rye mash bill. But it is bourbon. It's not age stated, but is, on average, six to eight years. So, yeah. Without further ado.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:06] I managed to get it on my shirt. So if we're doing video, hopefully, you can see that I need to not have this white shirt. But this is one of the Todd Snyder. It was cold today, so I was like, let me get one more use out of my cold weather stuff. But anyway.

**Chuck Carpenter: **[03:24] It continues to be warm here, and I think it was like 70 this morning at, like, 07:00 a.m. And I was like. It's going to get up there a little bit. Was planning to walk out to grab some lunch also later, so I think I better be prepared for that. So this is like a six-year-old Uniqlo Arizona polo. I used to wear these on the regular in DC. Because you're often sweating, and you want that to dry quickly as soon as you get indoors. They're tried and true. I still endorse those, but back to the whiskey.

**Robbie Wagner:** [03:53] I smell pine cones and honeysuckle.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [03:57] I definitely get some sweetness. I was going to say just kind of honey, but I don't mind catching, like, floral sweetness in that way. And a little bit of, like, an old leather belt. And actually, you know what? Some cola, but not like Coca-Cola. More like RC Cola. I smell a little RC Cola.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:14] Oh, yeah. Or like cola nut in general. Like less mass-produced cola and more like essence of cola.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:22] Yeah. Ode to cola.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:24] Yeah. Did you ever have the Pepsi 1880 something? Do you know I'm talking about?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:32] No, but did they release, like, old formulas or something?

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:35] I'm not sure if it was an actual old formula or if it was just they just used, like, cola nut, like sugar and very minimal ingredients.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:44] Yeah, I haven't had that, but it sounds like the ones you would get at like Sprouts or something. Like all natural sodas. And they'll have a cola flavor that would be, I think.

**Robbie Wagner:** [04:54] But made by Pepsi.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [04:56] Right. So not good, is what you mean. Sorry, we'll never be sponsored by Pepsi.

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:00] I actually liked it, but they were like, $4 or $5 for, like, a can of soda. Like, I'm okay. I don't need another one.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:08] That's not the appeal. Bespoke soda. I just took a little drink of it, and I still get a little bit of cola, but I also get, and I don't know, because you said nut, but like a little nuttiness. Like, I want to say, like, a walnut to it slightly.

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:24] So yeah, I'm getting some peanut M&Ms, I think.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:29] Which are the best?

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:30] Oh, yeah. Hands down.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:31] Yeah. It almost has, like, a little fizziness in the beginning of my tongue. Maybe a little bitterness, like from, like, a lime rind or something. Cola still. Little nuttiness. It's good.

**Robbie Wagner:** [05:44] Do we know how much rye is in this?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [05:46] Low. All we know is low because I get a little burn after I've taken my second sip now on the back of my throat. So it's like a light spiciness in there. A little hug. Yeah. It is only 90 proof.

**Robbie Wagner:** [06:00] Because for being a little lower proof and low rye, I think this is very complex and interesting. I'm pleased with it. I can see why people lose their minds and go to the ABC store and buy the, like, two they ever get.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [06:15] Yeah. So we might as well just go right into ratings then, because I think that like bang for your buck. This is usually between $25 and $30 most places, and it's fairly accessible. I mean, I find it pretty decently, and yeah, I mean, it's a great sipper. It's not just like this is on hand. I make cocktails with or whatever, which obviously could you won't feel bad about that given the low cost. I think it's like one of the best values for money on the market, given that cost in this taste. So given that I'm giving it an eight, I'd say it's just about perfect. For all of those reasons, I would constantly come back to this very easily. Go to the store. If this is available, I'm getting it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [07:03] Yeah. I'm realizing I think maybe the problem is we're spending too much money. So, like, getting some of these crappier or not crappier, but cheaper whiskeys is like it makes you feel better about it because it's a high bar if you spend $150 on a bottle.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [07:18] Exactly.

**Robbie Wagner:** [07:18] This has to blow me away for me to ever buy it again. But yeah, at this price point, this is, I think, the best thing you can get for $25.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [00:07:27] I agree.

**Robbie Wagner:** [07:28] I haven't tried everything that's $25, but I've tried a lot of them, and this one is up there. So I'm going to say eight.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [07:34] Yeah. I've had this a number of times. It's an easy go-to. I'll look at this and, like, Makers Mark and very many other mass-produced, readily available whiskeys, and I will just go for this every time because it's good, it delivers, and I'm never upset. I share it with friends. Everybody tends to agree. Everybody thinks, like, yes, this is good. I'm happy with this choice. And I think many of the others that we have reviewed that are 60, 70, up to $100 and that have given us okay feelings or whatever else feels like. So much of that is instead put into the marketing rather than the quality of the recipe and the product itself, all kinds of that. I saw this discussion in a whiskey group recently, and one person was saying, well, one person initially said, have this $300 bottle, finally decided to try it. And I was like, well, claps to you right there already because these aren't trophies. These are consumables meant to be had and enjoyed. And they were disappointed. They were like, oh, all this money, and that's crazy. And someone else said, yeah, I will never spend more than $100, ever, on whiskey, and oftentimes less than that because these reasons it's meant to be drank. I don't ever find most times when you have whiskeys that are $200 and more. They oftentimes tend to be like no better than a $50 one and, even so, very disappointing because you have all this hype and build-up around it and whatever else. I spent all this money, and now I want it to be great, and it's not great because it's just fine. And so then it's just hype and marketing, and I think that does often ring true, unfortunately. I'm glad you agree with your stoic view there on things. Well, we've settled on that Buffalo Trace really good, readily available, inexpensive. That is a top choice that I would give most people that are, like, recommend me a whiskey. Go get this one. You can get it, I mean, here you can get it at the grocery store or the pharmacy, which is interesting that a pharmacy sells liquor, but that happens here, and go for it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [09:49] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [09:50] So, let's talk about some web technology.

**Robbie Wagner:** [09:55] Yeah, I think it was the last episode. I never remember what order we do these in. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was that. We talked about date pickers recently. Yeah. So my advice still holds true, that you should never build your own. And while researching time pickers, I encountered another use case for native inputs. I found an old Bootstrap color picker that we were using. And Bootstrap requires you to ship a ton of stuff you don't need, and it needed jQuery and all of this bad stuff, and it was like on 6 like it was causing issues with everything. And I looked into how we were using it, and it was literally just the same usage as a native color picker. So there is a input type equals color, which it shows, like a little box of the color that's selected. And you click it, and it gives you this nice color wheel thing where you choose the color you want. And you can do a slider to change some stuff. And you can type in like HSL or Hex or different values. So it's really robust and just built-in into one line of HTML. So tons of bang for your buck there. So I thought it would be interesting if we went through just from memory what types of inputs do we know of, and then let's see which ones we missed. And just like, what new has been added that we had no idea existed?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:25] Oh, wow. Yeah, that's great. I know we talked about date last time. I believe I talked about the telephone type and that you can actually pass in regex as a pattern attribute in that we have email is an easy one, which checks some auto-formatting for correct email things.

**Robbie Wagner:** [11:45] Yeah. So adding to date, there's time. Specifically, there's date and time.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [11:50] You know what I love about time is that people implement things like time as a select or something. And then they've got to add all of the possible values in what other increment they can. And time is just the browser knows all the times. Can you set an increment attribute on that in any way? Like, maybe I want to set.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:09] You can.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [12:09] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:10] You can set increment, and you can provide it a list all the things you would expect from building your own and spending months maintaining it. It just does for you.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [12:19] It goes away. So much code could be deleted out there, and that brings me so much joy. Yeah. I think that's oftentimes. They'll ask what makes a senior engineer. And I think joy in deleting code is one of them. Like getting rid of stuff and not being attached to that, that I think makes you senior.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:40] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [12:40] Because early in your career, you make things, and you're just like, my little baby, I did this, and I think this is great, and it is all those things. But also, it's very satisfying to be like, I no longer need this because I've learned enough about my tools.

**Robbie Wagner:** [12:53] Yes. I opened a PR the other day that refactored, I think, 20 files to TypeScript and got rid of some weird two-way binding stuff. So it added fields, so it was like actual data down actions up versus two-way binding. So I added things, I converted things to TypeScript, which, you know, adds things, and the result at the end was like a net two-line deletion overall, like nothing added. I was like, yeah, we had a lot of really pointless stuff in here, right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [13:29] Which maybe made sense at the time. It's hard to say, but always looking to improve, right? Yeah. So are there more? Are there any other surprise inputs that we didn't name before?

**Robbie Wagner:** [13:42] I'm not sure. I was going to try to think of let me think of which other ones we missed. There's password so that you can't see it. It just makes it the little dots.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [13:53] Oh, yes, that's an obvious old one. But I mean, very good and worth pointing out.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:01] Number. I don't think we said number, right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:04] Yes, which is nice. But I think the funny thing about that is it's like type number, and it only lets you put numbers, and then I think has the little up-down thing for incrementing. But I think when you check it in JavaScript, like when you're saying like, whatever this input value, it's actually like a string or something weird, right? I feel like it is.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:27] So yes, all inputs are strings, but there is a I'm forgetting what it is now. I think it's like value as or something.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:37] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:38] You can basically say like as number.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:41] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [14:41] And so that then when JavaScript gets it, it won't be a string, but you can also just parse it. If you know it's a number input, you can say like parseInt or whatever.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [14:50] Yeah, see, I wrap it in the primitive right. An instance. Because I just like that for readability's sake. Right. I'll do that with booleans or whatever else. And it's very clear what this is. I don't do like bang bang or whatever, things like that. Yeah, it's a quick workaround, but I feel isn't as readable. So anyway, image. Come on. We forgot about image. Image.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:16] Yeah, image. That's the thing.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [15:19] Image input defined by the source thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:21] Yeah. So if you get the input and do value as number is what we're looking for. Sorry, I was looking that up.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [15:28] Okay. Yeah, I like it. All right, range.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:30] So, let's look at these.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [15:32] I'm looking now. I'm not this smart. Okay. Range is one. Oh, URL looks like a text input but has validation parameters and relevant keyboard support.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:44] Is it just like a regex?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [15:46] Yeah, I would imagine, but I like that. And then what was the only other one I saw here that was different? Oh, not different, but we just didn't file. Right. Automatically gives you, like, the choose file.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:57] Right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [15:57] Just a good one. Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [15:58] So, how is image different than file?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:03] Let's see here. Input type, image.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:06] Oh, graphical submit button.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:08] Interesting. Of an image rather than a text.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:11] I would never have done that. I would have just changed it with CSS.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:15] Which that's true. I don't think that one's a very good one now that I see it. But I see its usage, and I say, no, don't do that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:25] Yeah. And the obvious ones of checkbox and radio, we didn't say those, but.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:31] I mean, there's just input-type text. Right. Did you say text?

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:35] Probably not the default, no.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:38] Yeah. Well, there you go. You failed this interview. Thanks for applying, Robbie.

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:43] It's okay. I can invert a binary tree real quick.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:46] Well, can you do that real quick?

**Robbie Wagner:** [16:47] Yeah, I just use input type invert binary tree and input the binary tree in there.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [16:52] And I grab the input, and then I get the big O notation of its processing time. Do you know that? Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:01] Or you just ask ChatGPT.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:03] Right. Only if you're a paid subscriber will they give you that information.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:07] The Big O?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:08] Yeah, they'll give you Big O without big money. There's actually a tire place here called Big O Tires. So that's the Big O that I keep thinking of.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:18] Do they do tire changes really fast?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:21] Really fast, yes, actually.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:22] Like log time?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:24] Yeah. Depends on the size of the tire and rim combination. So you need to work on those combinations to make the efficiency there. You know, it turns out this isn't Whiskey Web Whatnot and jokes. Should be, though.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:37] It should.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:38] Further iterations.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:39] That title wasn't as catchy.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:41] Yeah. WWJ. What would see, it's got to be.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:46] Web.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:47] WWJD, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:49] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:50] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [17:51] Anyway.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [17:52] So web topics. I am going to skip past my second one for now because I feel like it's transitional to whatnot. Okay, so a little over a week ago because we've talked about Supabase on here before and heralded its ease of use and niceties and the fact that it isn't Firebase, Google-owned.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:11] And is endorsed by Nicki Minaj.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:14] Supabase is? Oh, my gosh.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:16] All right. Anyway, yeah, that's the joke thing again. I forget.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:22] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:24] Rimshot. So they launched some new features, a whole bunch of things, but in particular, some things that kind of stood out to me. One nice thing is around, like, because it is essentially a hosted database and then a bunch of modules around that to work with that database, but gives you auth and some other niceties, like, completely built into it. The resumable uploads which is a nice feature to have. Yeah. Catch the stream.

**Robbie Wagner:** [18:55] Very nice.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [18:55] And let you resume the stream. I love that. So I thought that was really cool. There's some things around their admin platform and their dashboard and some logging and other less sexy things. But I also like that as part of their whole self-hosting thing, you can do your own edge functions, right? So you basically can have your own Lambdas with their module. And that's supported through demo deploy as well in some other places. So that's kind of nice. So adding some of the nice things that are in Netlify and Vercel into their whole database hosted or cloud setup, I thought that was a really neat additional thing that I wouldn't mind playing with.

**Robbie Wagner:** [19:37] Yeah, I think the resumable uploads are amazing. I can't count the number of times that I have tried to upload or download something. And because I live in the middle of nowhere and had terrible Internet, it's like, oh, yeah, you're uploading this thing that's a gigabyte. And for normal people, it's still somewhat big. It might take a little time, but they would take me hours, and it'd be like, all right, you're 90% done. And oh, I failed. Okay, you can start over.

**Chuck Carpenter:**[20:07] Right. Exactly. You're like, no. That's all those BitTorrents you were trying to get, right? So you could get illegal games and stealing Nicki Minaj's album, all of those things, really.

**Robbie Wagner:** [20:21] I haven't done that in a long time. I used to steal a lot of stuff, as did we all, probably. But now that I've made some money in things, I just pay for everything. The only one thing I will never pay for, but I also don't steal anymore, is Photoshop.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [20:36] Right. Why did we all have copies of all of this crazy software? At some point? I think it's just so you could get it. It is how I learned Photoshop at first. Well, no, I guess it wasn't. I needed to get it, actually, for a photo course. And I was like, how much is it? It's like $400. I'm a student, so I'm trying to, like, no. And I had some friends help me get it and used it and learned it in that way for a while. And then you just kind of keep getting it that way for a while. I think it was just about seeing what you could get, not necessarily needing or using. I remember having crazy film and audio editing, things like, oh, and this is $1,000 software. I've never used it once. I never opened it once.

**Robbie Wagner:** [21:16] Yeah, but it was about seeing if the cracks worked and if you could keep it free and whatever. And yeah, there was a lot of bad stuff, but I mean, shame on Adobe for being like the people that buy this must already be professionals in this field because those people can afford it, of course. But if you want to learn and pull yourself up to be in that profession, no way are you spending the money they want.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [21:45] Yeah, and maybe that's why they switch to the subscribe thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [21:50] That's much more approachable.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [21:52]I guess. But I also don't like paying for software in perpetuity, like for as long as you have this if in two years from now you want to open it, you got to pay 24 months of subscriber thing. Or maybe I'm stupid, and I should not subscribe and go back and whatever. I don't know. Maybe there is a better model to that. And I feel like the subscriber model has gone everywhere. Like, my air conditioning company sold to my wife a subscription thing that was supposed to give us things like priority discounts on services and priority scheduling and all this kind of stuff. We did it for like six months and had a couple of leaks with our kitchen sink, and I didn't feel the priority at all. I was like, So why am I paying you $30 a month so that you collect $30 a month for people who forget about subscriptions?

**Robbie Wagner:** [22:45] Yeah, we have a similar thing with the people that cut our grass. They charge you all winter long to be like, oh, it's just a subscription, and you just pay the same amount every month. And I'm like, and hear me out, yeah, just charge me for the times you come out. I'd feel better about that.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [23:01] And they're like, well, if you do that if you cancel, we may not be able to fit you in next spring, and all that kind of stuff. Our pool people are like that because it does work out because they never don't come. They always come at least like once or twice a month, even in the winter when it's more dormant, but then chemicals don't evaporate as quickly and everything else, and then they come more in the summer, and it's like, same cost regardless. I'm a little more in that if they just didn't show up for months but still charge me, I'd be annoyed. I'd be really mad that this was still happening. So yeah, after another tech thing that I did want to bring up, talk about a little bit, just kind of like top of mind for various reasons. But it occurs to me as I go through tech Twitter nuances and topics and whatever else and you think about how last year was so inundated the last few years, I guess I'd say is so inundated with blockchain technologies and blockchain products and blockchain-related things and integrating the blockchain into every nuance of life. And then there was a massive crash for crypto. But it's not like these things went away. These technologies haven't gone away. I'm sure it's been a bit obscured and pushed to the back for everybody's interest in AI and ChatGPT and some of those other things and arguing now over like Rust and TypeScript, and I don't know, whatever, these are still underlying technologies. But what happened to blockchain? Do you think it's going to be a thing again? Do you think there'll be some rise?

**Robbie Wagner:** [24:31] Yeah, I haven't really followed the rise and fall of everything new as it comes out, but I think there's always a big, like, when someone announces something new and cool, like front-end JavaScript frameworks. When they first came out, there were a bunch of them. Everybody was really into them, whether they were good for them or not at the time, like just using it all over the place. And the same thing kind of happened with blockchains. I want to be the first people to make something. I want to have the first NFTs, the first coins because all of those are going to do the best because there's less competition. So getting in there really quick, then it becomes really saturated because 100,000 people did that, and you're like, oh, well, I used to think most NFTs were worth a good amount of money because they didn't have that many. But now that you can get everything as an NFT, it's kind of like, well, I think now it's more like an actual trading card or something. Like it's worth a dollar or two or whatever. But it's not like something I'm going to get rich on. So I think things that need to be trusted and immutable are, like, the biggest thing that it could be later is, like, we brought up a few times, like, doing history of all the maintenance you've done on your house and the times it's sold and all the info on that and stuff like that. Or like government documents. Things that shouldn't ever change. That kind of stuff, I think, has a good use case for it.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [25:57] Right. And you're not going to get the marketing power that was there before, right? Let's be honest. The people that were really pumping the technologies were those who would gain the most, I guess is what I'm saying.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:13] Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [26:13] And that has probably moved into the next phases of other bits where they can make more money and just, say, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain. Look at this party now. They're going to talk about whatever other thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:25] Yeah, like AI. You just put AI, AI, AI on anything, and it's worth tons of money now.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [26:29] How do I get a Lambo with AI? That's the real question because that was the big thing. Well, I got a Lambo, bro.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:37] Yeah. So I think in crypto, you could almost accidentally get a Lambo if you did things the right way.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [26:43] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [26:43] But in AI, I think you have to be building the AI. I am not smart enough to do the things you need to do to make tons of money. I guess you could invest in someone you believe in that's, like, you think could build the next best AI model. But I don't really know anyone doing that. And I think the people that know that they're smart enough to do that and know they're going to make tons of money already are talking to big pocket investors, not going to open it up to you and I to invest in their company.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:14] Yeah. To get involved. Right. They're not on Twitter going, buy my next art piece, pixelized art piece, and sell out and get rug pulled, as we may have been a couple of times.

**Robbie Wagner:** [27:29] Yeah, it happens some. I can turn myself into a pixelized art piece, look.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:34] Yeah. Whoa. Is that your filter?

**Robbie Wagner:** [27:36] Pixel filter. It's part of the camera.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:39] Eight-bit Robbie.

**Robbie Wagner:** [27:40] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [27:41] Anyway, well, like talking about places to have discourse around technology or any other subject matter you might like, everybody is just basically, I'd say, like 60% of the tweets I've seen the last couple of days are Bluesky invites, please.

**Robbie Wagner:** [27:59] Yeah, it's been huge. And obviously, I haven't gotten an invite, but those screenshots that I see of people, like, taking pictures of their accounts or their I guess they don't call them tweets, whatever they call them there, it looks exactly like Twitter. I feel like there's some major lawsuits that are going to happen here sometime soon, but, yeah, I think from what I've heard, everyone's like, oh, it feels a lot like when Twitter first came out. It's like just a different feel. It feels nice, and we all want to be here instead of on Twitter now, which is fine, except we can't all be there, and not everyone will move over. So it's kind of like it's the same with it feels like a better replacement than Mastodon. More people are going to it and staying there versus what happened with Mastodon, but it's still not going to be that great. I think maybe one day it will be amazing and everyone will be on it, and I'm certainly going to try it out and be there in case it does take off.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:03] Right, but it's sort of like, well, yeah, sure, it's great because it's a closed loop right now.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:09] Right.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:09] And if you have a small amount of people, they only want content from, and that's all you're seeing. Well, magically great. But if people did all move over, I mean, for now, you're curating the folks you want to engage with. And I guess if that's the thing you want, you could have done that a lot of places, right?

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:29] Yeah, I guess it remains to be seen if it will always be invite only or if there's going to be ways to game the system or how many bots will be there or not.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [29:42] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [29:43] If you could basically guarantee everyone has to have an invite from a person we've verified as real or something, and then we can control that there's basically no bots or dumb stuff on here, then that makes it interesting. It certainly also makes it interesting for ad revenue because you can be like if I put an ad on here, I can guarantee that all the people that are seeing it are like, real and interested or maybe not interested, but like, captive audience. So I don't know. I think there's a lot of cool potential, but I'm skeptical. But I'm always skeptical of things. And then they're like, the new best thing ever.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [30:21] Right. So it must be really good.

**Robbie Wagner:** [30:22] TikTok came out. Yeah. I was like, man, TikTok is dumb. No one's ever going to use this. It's just for little kids to post dance videos and do stupid things. And now it's like the biggest thing ever.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [30:34] I still kind of don't like it, though. I don't like short-form snippet, 30-second video, whatever thing. Like, talk about attention problems. You can't watch a five-minute video. I don't know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [30:47] Well, that's the thing. Is that's what people are now? Over half of the people are like. I can't possibly watch a thing that's more than, like, 30 seconds and doesn't have every couple of seconds fast-paced jokes or comedy happening or dancing happening or something to get my attention back. Because if you don't do that, I'm going to go like, all right, I'm 3 seconds into the video. Oh, something shiny across the room. It's really bad, and I agree that I hate it. However, I am going to accommodate and start making some videos because why not, right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:20] I'm staying out. You can have that one.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:23] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:23] I'm not doing it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:24] I think Wes Bos has, like, 50,000 followers on there or something, which was really surprising to me. I know he has a huge following all over the Internet, but I'm like TikTok. Like, really? But okay.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [31:36] I guess there's something for everyone. I don't know. I mean, if you think worldwide, right? How many devs are on there? I'm sure there's enough that are like, just want to get quick tip of the day, or whatever he's doing. I have no idea what he's doing there, but I can see him saying, like, I'm giving you one valuable piece of information per or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [31:53] Yeah, it's kind of like that, but still. I feel like I was planning on making one to five-minute videos and putting them on YouTube of being like, here's a quick tip. Here's how I would implement it. Whatever, so it takes a couple more minutes than like the quick 60 seconds or less video.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:11] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:12] And then still is very short, but maybe it's not short enough, I don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:16] Okay then. Yeah, I guess good luck with that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:19] Yeah, we'll see.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:21] Yeah, well, we'll see with all the things, I guess, in that sense. Yeah. Bluesky as the next. It's not really doing anything different. So that's where I have at least like TikTok, sort of. I mean, it didn't invent the short format video by any means. That was like Vine or something that made that popular first.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:38] Yeah, it's just Vine. They've made it better and nicer looking and snappier and whatever. But it's just Vine. Like all you kids, think you're doing something cool. We had Vine.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:48] Yeah. So I wonder then if something is ripe for reinvention. I don't know if it's Twitter, but maybe it's Facebook or something like that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [32:57] Talk about like Facebook is dead.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [32:59] It is a dead sandbox of just garbage. So maybe that is ripe for some kind of reinvention, then.

**Robbie Wagner:** [33:10] I think Facebook really is good for finding a person and being able to message them. I think it's a good, I found the person I meant to find, I can now contact them kind of platform, I think as a social media platform of people posting, hey, I'm doing this, or here's a picture or a video, it's dead. No one wants that anymore.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [33:31] No one wants that by any means. Yeah. Which is good. It's over-sharing got us in this problem. But I saw a thing recently that said like, Facebook Marketplace is the best part of Facebook. It's what Craigslist could have been kind of thing.

**Robbie Wagner:** [33:45] It is nice, except for when you get shot when you go to sell someone something.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [33:48] Right. Crazy is all over the place. I don't know. I mean, they've sold things on Craigslist. I actually did sell things years ago on Facebook Marketplace early on because you were able to get a really fast turnaround for things. And it was supposed to be like real people, at least. Craigslist, it could be like.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:07] Lets anybody on.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:09] Completely. There's no verification whatsoever.

**Robbie Wagner:** [34:12] Yeah, but still, I feel like it should be a third-party type of thing. I haven't used Poshmark or things that are out now where it's like have some old clothes and sell them or whatever. But I think those are like they do it right of like we're the middleman. We're going to print you like a shipping label or something. And then you just send it. That way, you don't have to be like, hey, what's your address? And I'm going to show up and knife you to death or take your money or something. It's just like we'll send it for you.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [34:44] It's hard, though, if you're like, I sold a desk on there when we moved into our house. We were coming from an apartment in DC and moved into a full-size house. We were like, wow, we barely have stuff for a regular house. So the previous owners left us some stuff. Certain things like there was an office desk or whatever else. It was like, okay, use this at first. Okay, I don't like it. I got a new desk. Sell it. You got to put it on Craigslist, put it on Facebook Marketplace. I don't know. I tried the Marketplace for that. And they got to come get it from you, right? You can't ship that. There's things of the larger nature. Then again, are you using furniture sales as your ability to murder and rob people? I don't know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:32] Maybe the desk killer.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [35:34] Yeah, the desk murderer. Yeah. So, I don't know. I think that was the only thing I ever sold on, like, some furniture things. I don't know. Clothes.

**Robbie Wagner:** [35:44] Yeah. I sold an Apple Watch one time, and this guy I think this happened to me twice. I'm trying to remember the time before, but I only sold a decent dollar value electronic like both times I did it. I forget what the first one was. The guy shows up, and we had agreed on, let's say, $300 or whatever, and he's like, oh, yeah, best I can do is 200 after showing up or whatever. And I'm like.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:12] Okay. Well, no.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:13] What? Both of these guys talked me down for, like, an hour of explaining to me why it needed to be this or whatever. And then the one with the Apple Watch also didn't have any money on him. We agreed on a price finally. And he was like, all right, walk with me to the ATM. I was like, okay, this is extra weird now.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [36:33] Yes. Yeah, I would not be cool with that. I'd be like, no, we're not talking. It's $300, or I'm leaving. Yeah, don't waste my time anymore.

**Robbie Wagner:** [36:43] What's? Also fun, I don't know if you got any of these. I think it was from Facebook Marketplace, or maybe I posted something somewhere else. But everyone that would contact you would be like, hey, I'm like a 68-year-old disabled truck driver with one leg, and I can't make it down there, so I'm going to need to PayPal you the money, and you ship it to me. And I'm like, first off, no. And second off, none of the things you just said are true, and you're just scamming me because, and I guess people fall for it, but when you PayPal someone, there's like a period where you can just be like, I can take the money back, like, void it or whatever. There's a way to get around. Or maybe it was Venmo that you could do that. There was something where I'd heard of people would send you the money, you would mail out the thing, and then, like, a couple of hours later, they would just take the money back. So everyone was trying to do that, and there was one guy who sent me some story similar to that of, like, oh, my daughter's disabled. Or they do something to try to pull on your heart stream, like, oh, we're disabled, and we really need this. And then they'll even give you more money. Like, you're asking 300, and they're like, I'll send you 800 for your trouble.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [37:57] Yeah, that is the immediate red flag to me of, like, okay, well, that's not going to work.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:04] I think I saw someone. I'm trying to remember the details now. Someone had a post about it where they scammed the scammer back and kept giving them reasons why they had to send money other places and do other things or whatever, and then just waited for they were like, hey, I'm not sending you the item now, or whatever. I don't know, but it was like something crazy where it was like a huge table saw or something that they couldn't mail. And he was like, all right, cool, I'll ship that to wherever I don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:34] Yeah, and then I guess that's the thing. Jokes on them if they send you the money, and then you're like, okay, cool, I'm not sending it to you at all.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:42] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:43] Nothing you can do about it. I don't know.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:45] Yeah, I don't know.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:46] Both sides of it, I guess.

**Robbie Wagner:** [38:48] Yeah, one guy, just like as soon as he sent his first message, I was like, hey, what's up, scammer? And he was like, damn you to hell, and just stop texting me. Like, wow, that got aggressive quickly.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [38:58] Yeah, okay, I'll see you there, buddy. Well, okay, so I don't know. Moral of the story is don't sell your tech on Facebook. Marketplace, maybe, or Craigslist, I'm not sure.

**Robbie Wagner:** [39:11] Don't sell things that are easily small, things that are valuable and easy to buy and sell and move, I guess. Like a desk. I think you would get people that are serious buyers because it's like, I actually want a desk. There's probably not much margin in stealing a desk.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [39:28] Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, furniture is good for that kind of thing. I feel like most of my tech I end up just like passing down. It's not often; I'm just like selling that one off. It's like, oh, I got a new Apple Watch. Passing that down to someone. The old one. Yeah, phones, for sure. I've been doing that for a while. Every time I upgrade a phone, somebody in the family gets a new phone.

**Robbie Wagner:** [39:53] Yeah, I've just been giving mine to my parents every time I get a new one.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [39:57] Yeah, same thing. Whatever works for them works for me. Everybody's happy?

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:01] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [40:02] Cool. So by the time this comes out, it'll be about time for the new Zelda game. And I think we mentioned it will bit before. Yeah, it'll be about release.

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:12] We'll be taking a several-week break from recording.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [40:14] Yes.

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:15] And working

**Chuck Carpenter:** [40:15] Yeah. So I'm really trying to decide when I'm going to. I should probably start it soon. I want to start Breath of the Wild again and just kind of get familiar with the gameplay and the story again and fiddle around and do some cool stuff. But I know that's going to be a slippery slope, and I've been letting my son play Super Mario Odyssey for a bit, so I'm like, am I going to stop his thing to do this? And then we got to go back and forth for a bit and blah, blah, blah. I don't know, but have you started Breath of the Wild?

**Robbie Wagner:** [40:44] Not recently. I think maybe like four months ago or something. I started it, like, before Hogwarts Legacy came out. I don't know when that came out because every month is the same. But before that, I was playing.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [41:02] Were you wearing sweatshirts or no?

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:04] I have no idea. I couldn't tell you. But I played probably like a week or so. Like, I'd play every night after work, and then yeah, something happened to where I like, I do that a lot. If I stop playing a game for a couple of minutes, I'm just out of that. I don't know, the dopamine cycle, I guess. And I'm like, hey, I don't want to start it back up.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [41:26] Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, I kind of done that a couple of times. Like, buy a game, play it for a few days in a row, and stuff. And then, like, okay, I got the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater one and two or whatever that was on sale. Grab that, start playing. Having a little like, I remember how fun this was. I'm really bad at this right now. Okay, now I can do a couple of tricks onto level two. Oh, this one's harder. Okay, I think I'm going to take a break now. I forget how to do everything, so why pick it up again?

**Robbie Wagner:** [41:55] Yeah, it's also hard because I was playing some Xbox games and also Switch games. And I don't know if I've complained about this on the podcast before, but they have the same button letters in different locations, so it's like press X, and I'm like, I don't know where that is anymore because I'm confused because I've played both systems and oh, I died. I can't figure out what to press when anymore. So I kind of have to commit to a game at a time. And just like, when Zelda comes out, I'm going to play just it for a couple of months or whatever.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:35] That makes sense. Yeah. I mean, what you need to do is get like a third-party controller that you can start in various modes. So then or something like that or remap it or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [42:46] Yeah, that sounds nice.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [42:47] Yeah. There's the 8BitDo controllers. I have a couple of them, and my brother recommends them because you can pre-program some stuff and then turn it on as an Xbox controller, but then switch where things are or vice versa, that kind of stuff. You want everything to be Xbox. Then you can be like. Here it is for Switch. But then I remapped.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:10] Interesting. Yeah, I'll have to check that out.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:12] Yeah, they're like 50 bucks. 40, 50 bucks on Amazon. Looks like a PlayStation controller. Or there's one that looks like NES controller but then has the extra stuff on there. There's some pretty neat ones.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:24] Nice.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:25] Yeah. That's our video game talk for the moment. There's a Star Wars game coming out soon, actually, on the EA site for PC. It's like, what was the one with the character Cal in it?

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:42] I don't know, but I know what you're talking about. I think the red-haired kid that's like that one actor that's actually a person.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [43:49] Yes.

**Robbie Wagner:** [43:50] Yeah, I haven't played any in a while, any Star Wars games, because I'm just like, I think I'm scared that they're going to let me down. So I don't play them. I played several when I was like twelve or something. There was dark forces for PC. I don't know if you played that ever. Yeah, I guess they were all for PC. I mean, there were gaming systems, but I would play stuff on PC because the games were better than what was on Nintendo or whatever. Yeah, so yeah, I played that, and there was another one where it was more Jedi based, and you could decide if you're going to be good or evil, and based on your actions and stuff, I think you would get Dark Force powers if you did too many dark things or something. And it was cool.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [44:38] Yeah, I remember that one because they kind of ported it to Switch or something, but then it just wasn't quite exactly the same. Knights of the Old Republic or something like that. I think it was. Is that the one you mean where you can kind of become, or there's Force Unleashed? I think that was a good one. One of those where you can kind of.

**Robbie Wagner:** [44:56] I'm not sure.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [44:56] Skew your character. Well, this was like the new one is called Survivor, and it's like the Fallen Order sequel. And Fallen Order was really good. So I don't know. I think I played it on Switch, actually, or something I had to have because I didn't have PC options for quite some time. But I don't know. I found that game to be really good and fun, and so in terms of you might be disappointed with Star Wars games. There's plenty of those that have been. I typically had just only played the Lego ones because it's like kitschy enough to where you don't care.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:32] I play a lot of the Lego ones.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [45:34] Yeah, they are super fun. It's kind of whatever, but yeah. Oh, I know what it was when I had Stadia, right? Like the loss of Stadia, having this online gaming thing and you could play all over the place. I play on my TV, and then I could play on my iPad on the go or whatever else. And I love that. So I played Fallen Order there. And so fun.

**Robbie Wagner:** [45:59] Yeah, it is kind of annoying that it's gone. I feel like it was ahead of its time. Because the thing that you don't want to do to play a game, if there's a new game these days, they want you to download it versus buying a physical copy. Which there are pros and cons to both.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [46:16] Sure.

**Robbie Wagner:** [46:16] But then like a Star Wars game, if you went to download it would be like 300 GB or something insane. Whereas if I can just stream it, it just has to boot up on that machine, and like, yeah, there's going to be some latency of me playing it or whatever, but I don't have to sit there and wait for the download for like a day before I can play.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [46:37] I was pretty pleased with the quality of it overall. I never really had issues with streaming. Yeah, it's a real miss. There somebody getting that right and sticking with it, and I don't know. People's complaints around Stadia were just like, not enough games available, I guess. But I was happy with it with my very passive gaming timelines. Like, okay, I'll get in and out of stuff, and it's nice to not have to have a dedicated machine for it, have to think about hardware and, like you said, downloads or whatever else it's going to be. It's just like I could pick up some games if I want.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:13] Yeah, I used it to play Destiny 2 a couple of times. It was just so that I didn't have to bring my Xbox to my parent's house because I would always be there for Christmas, and there would always be like a Christmas event, and I want to get the cool Christmas swag right. So you got to at least login and grab some stuff. So there was an easy way to do that and not have to carry anything. Really.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:35] I've heard the Xbox streaming experience is actually pretty decent. I don't know if you've tried that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:42] I have not. If you remember where I live now, it's not really an option. Yeah, I mean, I have Starlink now, but I don't think it would do well.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [47:51] Yeah, I thought some people were able to game on Starlink, but perhaps not where you're at.

**Robbie Wagner:** [47:56] Well, you can game, but not streaming the game, I think.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:00] Well, maybe someday when you move back to civilization.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:05] Hey, if anyone will buy our house. So I don't remember if it was the last episode. We talked about the people doing crazy offer stuff.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:11] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:12] But they came in insanely low after all of that. 30 or 40% lower than asking price.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [48:22] Oh, wow.

**Robbie Wagner:** [48:23] And I was like, excuse me. And then they also had a bunch of extra stuff. Like it was no contingencies technically, but they were like, you will get the solar panels and their wiring and the batteries inspected within 15 days of ratification and at your expense. And you'll provide us a report of it and all of this, you're going to get rid of your brush pile and do all these things. And I'm just like, no, you want to pay us less than we paid for the house, and you want us to do all this stuff? I don't think so.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:00] Right. At that point, is negotiation over? Right? I mean, if it's so low, first of all, like, just price alone, it's like not even in the ballpark. So you just say no, and that's that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:13] Well, yes, I thought about basically coming back with asking price and just being like, here's my counter. But rather than be a dick, I was just like, hey, if you want to try again, you can, but I'm not going to respond to this.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:29] Yeah, it's insultingly low.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:31] Yeah. They're like. We don't want to try again right now. So it's like, all right, cool, whatever.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:36] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:38] But interestingly, our neighbors just listed their house for way less than we're asking, which is going to help us a lot. Of course.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [49:48] Yeah. Comps in the neighborhood. Yeah. Cool. Well, maybe you just need to embrace farm life for a little bit.

**Robbie Wagner:** [49:57] Well, I mean, I'm certainly not going to sell my house at a loss. I would have to be in a really bad spot to do that. So we might be here a while.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:05] Yeah, I mean, you can make the most of it.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:08] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:10] Well, good luck.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:11] Yeah. Thanks. With our last couple of minutes, what have you been watching? Anything fun?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [50:17] Let's see here. I've been watching the last season of Titans because I really enjoy that show. And I'm sad that it is going away. But the last episode was really weird. It was like trying to be kind of trippy and has I don't know if you've seen that or familiar with the characters, but it had this character Gar, who typically just turns into animals. Apparently, he's unable to further unlock his ability to restructure his molecules and can go into another universe or some weird shit. I don't know. It was a little weird when watching that. Continue to watch Mandalorian, and I watched the most recent episode of that.

**Robbie Wagner:** [50:58] Oh, yeah. I mean, that was the end.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:00] Yeah.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:00] I didn't realize that it was out until, like, a couple of days ago. So I watched like the first two or three episodes. But I'm sure I'll finish that in the next couple of days.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:12] Yeah, won't take long. Use that when you jump on the Peloton or something.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:15] Well, I got to watch the Peloton instructor and know what to do. I can't watch a show.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:21] Right. Can't just watch a show.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:22] Which is kind of a downside.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:24] Yeah. No, when I row, I just want to zone off. And I'm trying to go for length of time now. So like, oh, 30 minutes row. I can't just watch the rower, so I watch a show.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:34] Yeah. Like at my parent's house. They have an elliptical with no fancy instructor screen or anything, so I just get on that and put a show on, and yeah, it's like mindless exercise.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:44] Yeah. No, I think it's good. It's better than nothing. And then we just started the recent season of Succession.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:52] Which is also the last one, right?

**Chuck Carpenter:** [51:54] Yeah, I believe it is. Many lasts many finals.

**Robbie Wagner:** [51:57] Yeah. I don't know when it's coming out, but I saw a tweet from Witcher that was like, hold tight till tomorrow or something, which I'm guessing meant it was coming out the next day.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:11] Okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:11] There may be new episodes of Witcher out. I'm not sure.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:15] Yeah, well, that would be interesting in this season, though. It's not Henry Caviezal anymore, right? Or is it?

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:23] No, this is last season and then it's okay. What's? The Hemsworth guy? We figured out who it was last time. Not Chris.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:32] Liam. Liam?

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:34] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:34] Liam's, the other one. Right, okay.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:35] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [052:36] I think there's like more brothers, but those are like the two famous ones.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:40] Yeah, I think there's another one that's it's like the third Jonas Brother. Like, no one knows that guy.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [52:44] Yeah, not as much. And he's not like huge and shredded or something. Turns out it's like the other brother looks like them, but it's like half the size.

**Robbie Wagner:** [52:53] Yeah. But also, at least being the third Jonas Brother, you make theoretically a third of the money from being in the band.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [53:01] Right.

**Robbie Wagner:** [53:02] There's also another Manning brother, right, too, who doesn't play football. Being that kind of third brother has got to just be like, oops.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [53:13] Why didn't I hang out with them more?

**Robbie Wagner:** [53:15] Yeah.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [53:15] Shouldn't have been mean to them.

**Robbie Wagner:** [53:16] Yeah. Every time they asked me to play football in the backyard, I was like, no, I'm going to read this book. Like, I wish I had gone and played football in the back.

**Chuck Carpenter:** [53:23] Exactly.
