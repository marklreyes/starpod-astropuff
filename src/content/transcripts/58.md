[00:00:00] What's up everyone? My name is Mark and those two over there, that's Darrell and Mike, two of my like-minded friends who I roped into having adult conversations powered by cannabis. Were simply three dads, husbands, and full-time desktop athletes striving to figure out how recreational cannabis plugs into our modern day world.

Why do vape pens look like USB drives? Should I smoke it or eat it? What would my kids think? We're problem solving our way through this type of mentality on a daily basis, and we decided to capture it in audio. For those of you pondering the same things, but be warned, we speculate a ton and get stuck in God's fridge quite a bit.

You can blame that on the munchies. So if you're comfy with that, come on in, pull up a chair and kick back and welcome to the Puff Provisions podcast.

**Mark:** [00:01:00] Are we on? We are on. Hey everyone. Welcome to another edition, episode 58 of the Puff Provisions podcast. I am one of three of your hosts at Puff Provisions Mark, and these two are already throwing me under the bus. Welcome. Why? What did I do to you guys? What? What did I do? I can't even do the cold open for this episode.

**Mark:** What the hell is wrong with you? How rude.

**Darrell:** feel

**Mark:** Tingly. I'm gonna put you on pause later. Let me finish the intro. May I? How rude. Thank you. Episode 58. Welcome to episode 58 of the Puff Revisions podcast. We are back with a brand new set of stuff for you to talk about and to my middle with his Padres hat and getting excited because the baseball season is coming back.

**Mark:** Our only professional sports team here in San Diego. How you doing at Puff Provisions, Mike?

**Mike:** No,

**Mark:** You are the whole professional sports seats because we do have another sports seat. Yeah, we do. Explain, no.

**Mark:** football club.[00:02:00]

**Darrell:** Yep.

**Mark:** Okay. The FC Club. That's right. Okay. San Diego FC Club. That's right. Okay. But they don't, they're not, are they opening sometime in the spring? Is that why you got confused?

**Mike:** this, they, I don't know if they already had a game, but

**Darrell:** I think it was like

**Mark:** One of the homies just

**Mike:** they're

**Mark:** told me they're gonna a game this

**Mike:** Saturday or

**Mark:** Saturday or something. Okay.

**Darrell:** That's huge

**Mark:** That's a big deal.

**Mike:** yeah.

**Mark:** a big deal.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mike:** I want to

**Mark:** That's a big deal. I wanna pick up San Diego. Okay, we're gonna have to talk about that later. And if, do you guys wanna sponsor us? San Diego, CU would be glad to be there and root for you on day one.

**Mike:** Go fc.

**Mark:** Day two.

**Mike:** I don't know what they say.

**Mark:** I don't know what to say. We have to establish new traditions. Fellas. Go football team because he Hi Dean. You know who we are? Hi Dean. We don't, you can keep renting your stadium, that's fine.

**Darrell:** gosh,

**Mark:** but no man, come on. Get excited. Even though the other team won the World Series, it's good to have baseball back coming soon and we gotta get out there and have some fun, right?

**Darrell:** With MLS, there's a good

**Mark:** A good [00:03:00] chance.

**Darrell:** because Messi team also is on MLS. There's a chance like they, those teams could be in a game and we get

**Mark:** That'd be good.

**Darrell:** Diego.

**Darrell:** That's gonna

**Mark:** would be extremely special. Because that is basically like the he, he and what Ronaldo are like obviously. Yeah. Those are the Michael.

**Darrell:** and

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** And then Ronaldo's

**Mark:** got Ronaldo's, the.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** No, isn't Ronaldo like the Jordan of professional? Yeah, I think it's Ronaldo.

**Darrell:** that's

**Mark:** And then question.

**Darrell:** You don't

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** soccer fans.

**Mark:** I could get killed for that one. So yeah, I don't

**Darrell:** If you just

**Mark:** see me as a novice. I'm a novice fan. I don't know shit about it, to be perfectly honest, except kick the ball. Into the goal. So you know what, I'll let the culture come to me and the influence come to me versus me trying to be the influencer of it all.

**Mark:** But that's exciting. But no, man, we gotta get back to a baseball game. We gotta get back to Peco Park. The beauty of Peco Park, it is spring, soon after D Is this the second [00:04:00] winter of California? It was like

**Darrell:** fa fool.

**Mark:** full summer, full spring. That's right. At the time of this recording, it's going through a heat wave .

**Darrell:** It's

**Darrell:** Rain on Monday.

**Mark:** Something's. Something's definitely not up with that. It's raining next week.

**Darrell:** saw it, so

**Mark:** I did. Yeah. And

**Darrell:** up.

**Mark:** so at the time of this recording, because obviously we're not gonna boot this up tomorrow, it is end of the month and I think the more trippy thing that I'm excited about versus fool's spring and second winter is the something special's happening.

**Mark:** And these stars, these planets specifically are aligning. You catch wind of that, Venus, Mars, they're all on the same planetary,

**Mike:** Oh, really?

**Mark:** I'm trying to Yeah. There you can actually capture. Yeah. We're all on an equal an equal plane where you can actually see all of the planets.

**Mark:** If you have a telescope, obviously it's better.

**Darrell:** Yeah, it's three. You can see

**Mark:** No, it's all of them. Oh yeah. But you need to make an effort for the other ones with a telescope. I

**Darrell:** I was

**Mark:** was watching

**Darrell:** God, I'm old. I was

**Mark:** I was watching Neil Degrassi.

**Darrell:** news.

**Mark:** Neil. Neil Degrassi. You mean Neil [00:05:00] deGrasse? Tyson.

**Darrell:** I'm

**Mark:** Tyson. I'm sorry. Neil deGrasse Tyson.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Oh, God. He was talking about how

**Darrell:** this isn't really that uncommon and that this would be another one

**Darrell:** Two years.

**Mark:** What a, you know what guy? Don't Why'd you have to deflate me?

**Darrell:** the movies, man. They made

**Mark:** Yeah. Why?

**Darrell:** this is

**Mark:** This is when the bad guy

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** When the

**Mark:** Fucking planet.

**Darrell:** Or like

**Mark:** is when the planets aligned. This is exactly when you Thanos appears, right? Yeah. When the planets aligned.

**Darrell:** pops outta nowhere.

**Mark:** Seriously. And this guy's trying to gaslight it and calm it down.

**Mark:** And I'm like, nah, come on. Nah, Neil, come on. You're an exciting astronomer. But no I'm excited about that one kind of trippy that leads me into the THC space a little bit, but No, tonight, gentlemen, it is about CB, D for the family. And exploring non-psychoactive substances. Now, traditionally, you guys give me a hard time all day, every day for puffing on a little CBD to calm my nerves down, and you're more than free to do that still.

**Mark:** [00:06:00] But

**Darrell:** to clean my mirrors, but.

**Mark:** can you recommend any good products that allow you to do that?

**Darrell:** Get those

**Mark:** You're just gonna put it right out there. You're just gonna bur

**Darrell:** CBD Spritz.

**Mike:** CBD

**Mark:** You're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna burn all the bridges for all of these brands and products before we can even get ahead our Hold on 'em. Wow. I'd like to apologize for,

**Darrell:** is to use a microfiber cloth. You just get more coverage than paper towel.

**Mike:** d

**Mark:** they just said

**Mike:** thanks. But

**Mark:** but no thanks

**Mike:** companies

**Mark:** companies that,

**Mike:** thinking of sponsoring us. Darrell just said thanks, but no thanks.

**Mark:** you, you just burn bridges right there.

**Darrell:** Just

**Mark:** just hang on to that.

**Darrell:** me.

**Mark:** What if it had a minute percentage of THC? They all do. CBD has a minute percentage, very minute. I

**Darrell:** I knock on it a lot, but to be honest, like CBD has helped me in the past,

**Darrell:** Especially for sports injuries or gym injuries?

**Darrell:** I don't know. It

**Mark:** Kind.

**Darrell:** by like [00:07:00] coincidence, but I had a, I was given like a free sample of CBD South and

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** in my gym bag and whenever

**Mark:** whenever something

**Darrell:** happens at Jiujitsu or at the gym, lo and behold, a

**Mark:** the cbd,

**Darrell:** sample that I have in my bag.

**Mark:** what kind of ailments do you have right now?

**Darrell:** My joints,

**Mark:** All of them knee joints, elbow joints, wrists, fingers.

**Mark:** Said, my

**Darrell:** my, my thumbs are screwed up from Jiujitsu.

**Mark:** And Mike still doesn't wanna try be a trial guy. Okay.

**Darrell:** man, once he feels the power. Once, see

**Mark:** Oh man.

**Mark:** Night.

**Darrell:** Night. Once you

**Mark:** every night you get night ba, north, south. You're going to, you're you're gonna be asking the, you're gonna be asking the Puff Provisions wife to get you in north-South. That's all I'm gonna say. Yes. It's amazing how empowered you feel when you can control another person's hips and the direction they take.

**Mark:** [00:08:00] That's all I'm gonna say, and that's probably the reason why you need CBDD, because you've been doing all of those sports and high impact things

**Darrell:** It's nice

**Mark:** Nice for

**Darrell:** it's nice for the joints I've taken both, the salve and also like a pill.

**Darrell:** Done like a vape,

**Darrell:** All the different of CB, D I've done that and, it's been helpful. But, I prefer my THC.

**Mark:** Oh, that's true for sure. I'd rather, now this is to set kind of boundaries to it kind of mentality. It's like there's a place for CBD and then there's a place for THC kind of mentality. I do. I did get introduced to Sal. Do you remember when legalization happened in California and then all of a sudden.

**Mark:** Retailers, like started carrying CBD

**Darrell:** was

**Mark:** and that was that was funny and weird, right? It's and they're really, the price was crazy

**Mark:** It was like

**Darrell:** they have both shirts in the back,

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** And

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** wins, they just bring one shoe, one box out, and the other box goes to a third world [00:09:00] country, right?

**Mark:** It goes the third. So the, those yeah, those Threepeat

**Darrell:** it was

**Mark:** Kansas City shirts are gone.

**Darrell:** right?

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** when the passing of recreational THC was legalized,

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** a sudden, like everyone had the

**Mark:** I would've The boxes the

**Darrell:** bring them

**Mark:** them out. Yep.

**Darrell:** out, let.

**Mark:** I found it back in the day. I found it really weird when I'd go to A Sprouts and it'd be right there next to the vitamin supplements and stuff like that, and I'm like, they just randomly put it in a spot kind of mentality trying to really oversell it.

**Darrell:** one pays no mind to it.

**Mark:** Exactly. Because like I, I look at it, this is back in the day, I do a double take. It's like C, b, D, for real. And then you'd read the label, but then I'd put it back when I'd see the price and I'd be like, ah, no, I'd kind truthfully, I'd be like, let go get my Tylenol and then I'll pop that.

**Mark:** Not condoning that, by the way. I'm just saying that's the truth and this is what it is.

**Darrell:** Tylenol has its place.

**Mark:** Yep. But now the concept of CBD and things of that nature, before I derail myself, Mike's laughing at me. Why are you laughing at me? Is it because it's the [00:10:00] football team? All right. I like your glasses, by the way.

**Mark:** I like your glasses. I really like them. They look, he looks like Bret. The hit. He looks like Bret The Hitman Hart right now.

**Darrell:** Hey

**Mark:** I really like them. He looks good. Spring training Mike. Yeah, I know, right?

**Darrell:** I know you're

**Mark:** Seriously. From,

**Darrell:** us from

**Mark:** you're calling us from he's calling us from a Arizona. Yep. No, but is

**Darrell:** C-B-D-C-D

**Mark:** that shoulder, like right there.

**Mark:** Yep. And if anyone, put some CBD over my high rollers Brazilian Jiu Jitsu shirt, here you go. Let's put that right there. Kinda mentality. I keep saying CB, D about ourselves and obviously we have our opinions on it. But c, b, D for your loved ones, your peers, do you, would you recommend that?

**Mark:** Is that something where it'd be part of the conversation? You're, let's play pretend your wife at Puff Provisions, wife at Puff Provisions. Children. Dare I say or in some kind of ailment. Physical, we'll go physical. That's a better way to start it off. Just a physical ailment, whatever the case may be.

**Mark:** [00:11:00] Yeah. Is it something you'd entertain or are you gonna stick to traditional stuff that we were taught from when we were kids all the way up, prescriptions, rest and pill pop and Advil and Tylenol. Honestly, let's just say for example, I, at Puff Provisions mic, you have children that are doing intramural sports now, right?

**Mark:** Basketball in particular. What are the common injuries of basketball? Honestly. I don't know. I don't know them by the way. I know my hands.

**Darrell:** Feelings.

**Mark:** knuckles. Yeah. Besides,

**Darrell:** Hurt.

**Mark:** no, if you have hurt feelings, then, if hurt feelings require a little bit of ice cream, then no. THC then ice cream.

**Mark:** There you go. But that's for the adults, that's the adult recommendation, not for the children. But what are the common ailments of a basketball game?

**Mike:** A

**Mark:** Or a playing or a ba? Excuse me. See, I'm not even high. I just can't frame the question correctly. What are the common injuries in basketball?

**Mike:** Common

**Mark:** Common injuries in basketball?

**Mark:** I'm not a doctor. I don't know that, I don't know. That shit bruise like a deep

**Mike:** Not

**Mark:** bruise. Not just like a regular bruise, a deep bruise to where it, you can't, oh. It goes it's a really deep bru bruise to the bone. Like closer to the bone?

**Mike:** exactly.

**Mark:** Ah, okay. Like you.

**Mike:** Basically almost

**Mark:** almost like if you've had a sprain.

**Mark:** I don't, I dunno if the pain is the same way. Uhhuh, but like

**Mike:** mobility

**Mark:** mobility is very limited due.

**Mark:** Mike you expose your children to that. That's, yeah, we do that. Okay. All right. Gotta make some, gotta make some players. All right. All right. Geez. Geez.

**Mark:** You be. Would you be in, heaven forbid you gotta go to the ER or just go see your your physician, your primary care doctor to handle the situation. You go into that dialogue and stuff like that, and then all of a sudden it's okay, your doc, your nurse throws the throws, the recommendation or the prescription at you.

**Mark:** Hey, maybe I should use CBD for this air.

**Mike:** Not

**Mark:** Nah,

**Mike:** Exactly right.

**Mark:** Exactly. Yeah.

**Mike:** Reading

**Mark:** reading,

**Mike:** researching. Calf

**Mark:** that calf sleeve, right?

**Mike:** I bought a

**Mark:** Bought a roller.

**Mike:** I spent

**Mike:** and

**Mark:** Oh, okay. I know that. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. And then you roll it off.

**Mike:** Yeah,

**Mark:** yep. Exactly. It's like a mini massage for the calf. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But highly pressurized. Yep.

**Mike:** Did tons of

**Mark:** But did other research spent

**Mike:** time, and

**Mark:** time, and energy on fixing this calf?

**Mark:** All right. All

**Mike:** And not

**Mark:** And not once in any of that, of

**Mike:** c, b,

**Mark:** CD. To all the CBD companies out there. You need to market yourself better.

**Mike:** of a cannabis

**Mark:** Cannabis company, you need to market yourself better because if he's thinking about that, there's a little something to fix.

**Mark:** What if

**Mike:** oh, go ahead.

**Mark:** Go. Sorry.

**Mike:** Go ahead. Go ahead.

**Mark:** Is it because you were just in excruciating pain to not.

**Mark:** To not think anymore? Or was it because when you were researching, like you said, all across, I, a lot of [00:19:00] diagnosing on Google, I suspect

**Mark:** everything telling, pointing you in that direction? Ibuprofen, rollers, compression, peripherals and things like that?

**Mike:** Oh,

**Mark:** Honestly. Oh yeah. Okay. So you were guided by an algorithm, okay.

**Mark:** Yes. Here we go. Personally still smoke. Yeah, of course. Of course. Still smoke. And I was like, oh,

**Mike:** a

**Mark:** relax a little bit

**Mike:** relax

**Mark:** and relaxing my muscles,

**Mike:** body. I

**Mark:** body. I wanna float. Yeah,

**Mike:** I took a

**Mark:** I took a hit,

**Mike:** Took a

**Mark:** Yeah. Couple. Okay.

**Mike:** Not

**Mark:** Not

**Mike:** I think, oh, you

**Mark:** oh, you know what?

**Mike:** Let me go to the

**Mark:** Let go to the store. Some

**Mike:** salve.

**Mark:** gentlemen

**Mike:** Let me

**Mark:** let.

**Mike:** the store and buy these drops that go

**Mark:** Go underneath my

**Mike:** and make my body feel better.

**Mark:** gentlemen. The this is my CBED pen from Ste. Not a pen. It's just basically, you know what it is. It's that and then I just chose this cartridge and in it and it is the CBD to be fair.

**Mike:** to be

**Mark:** To be fair. STIIIZY. I got you.

**Mike:** To be[00:20:00]

**Mark:** Be fair. To be fair.

**Mike:** To be

**Mark:** To be fair to the.

**Mike:** or mirror and window. Mirror and window cleaner,

**Mark:** That's fine. Side here of your car, spray a little bit of that. CBD

**Darrell:** Streak.

**Mark:** on street,

**Mike:** streak

**Mark:** on

**Mike:** I have

**Mark:** I have yet to consume CB D and

**Mike:** and fields

**Mark:** feeling effects. Feel okay. Got it. Now, mind you, it's been very few and far between.

**Mike:** the

**Mark:** Has that

**Mike:** but

**Mark:** maybe? Yeah.

**Mike:** I

**Mark:** I never had,

**Mike:** really

**Mark:** Part of it,

**Mike:** and I

**Mark:** yeah.

**Mike:** effective it is. I

**Mark:** First off, taking Tylenol aspirin since I've been a baby.

**Mike:** I know it works.

**Mark:** First off, it's not that I want you to actually explore CBD in that context because that means you got injured again. No, I don't wish that

**Mike:** I still have

**Mark:** still have it.

**Mike:** still

**Mark:** It's still tight

**Mike:** but

**Mark:** Uhhuh,

**Mike:** good now.

**Mark:** but it's more so the fact that there's a big disconnect between a person who has an ailment and a solution in. Basically [00:21:00] a non-psychoactive substance.

**Mark:** Maybe it's also too psychologically we frame things and it with an expectation that if it says cannabis on the box, it better get me going. It better get me high. That's the way, that's the way I selfishly think with my dense head, I can't, I, even though I know, understand the difference between the two THC and CBD, I just can't fa figure out psychologically how to disconnect the two.

**Darrell:** yeah.

**Mark:** Because, yeah, of course I've tried both. I, you guys see me in both lanes. But may, that's part of the struggle I see from here having this, I think it's also not,

**Darrell:** it being looped in with the whole stigma of cannabis.

**Mark:** I agree,

**Darrell:** most people you're playing, Jane doesn't know difference between CB, D and THC, so it's all locked in under this same umbrella.

**Mark:** Yeah, that's true. I thought we fixed that eight years ago, but I, or at least six, five to six years ago, but I guess not garner some better understanding.

**Darrell:** about it.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** that. And to

**Mark:** To like

**Darrell:** prove my point. My, my mother-in-law when she was [00:22:00] going through her one of

**Darrell:** That she would use for her body aches because she had, especially has a specific ache, I think on her elbow or something like that.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** one of the things she would use at some time was actually like CBD cream.

**Mark:** Because sometimes she, she take medications.

**Darrell:** and her

**Mark:** Medications

**Darrell:** for the pain, she can't

**Mark:** she can't take.

**Darrell:** only c allotted like a certain amount a day.

**Darrell:** So she needed something else. And you can't mix that with Tylenol or Advil.

**Mark:** Yeah. Of course not. No. That I'm not prop, I'm not being a proponent of that. I'm not promoting that.

**Darrell:** one of

**Mark:** One of the alternatives and

**Darrell:** the,

**Mark:** the

**Darrell:** The I forget what the name of the folks are there. They're not really like nurses, but they're like those cancer

**Mark:** specialist. Okay. Yeah.

**Darrell:** they suggested because they use it with their cancer patients also. So a

**Mark:** so a lot of cancer patients,

**Darrell:** from CBD

**Mark:** okay.

**Darrell:** This is the perfect scenario for it, is because once they're taking their meds, they can't take anything else.

**Darrell:** CBD is like a alternative to.

**Mark:** to,

**Darrell:** Pain treatment, [00:23:00] pain management without taking any more medicine in.

**Mark:** and there were no additional side effects when discussed with these nurse practitioners or physicians or anything like that.

**Darrell:** her personal

**Mark:** personal,

**Darrell:** when I asked

**Mark:** asked her about it, was that

**Darrell:** it

**Mark:** it takes too long to kick in. Yeah. Yeah. And I think I showed her how to use it.

**Darrell:** cup.

**Mark:** You are like, wax on, wax off.

**Darrell:** Both.

**Mark:** And I think

**Darrell:** right off.

**Mark:** that's the thing. It's just I think the association to, you label it as part of the subset of cannabis. You expect it to hit you in that way.

**Mark:** Yeah. So

**Darrell:** talking about

**Mark:** talking about the stigma.

**Darrell:** Standoffish to even to her nurse about taking it because.

**Darrell:** Of it is,

**Mark:** Of course.

**Mark:** Yeah. So she didn't, she actually refused.

**Darrell:** and we had to talk to her about it because she was asking us, and I'm like, I've never smoked before, mom. I don't even know what you're talking about.

**Mark:** Classic heard,

**Darrell:** I've heard, and I've read through the [00:24:00] grapevine that, it's.

**Mark:** according to Google,

**Darrell:** According to

**Mark:** a.

**Darrell:** googly. It was, it's

**Mark:** It's okay

**Darrell:** it's that, and

**Mark:** that,

**Darrell:** and the reassurance of her doctor and all of that. She

**Mark:** See,

**Darrell:** carried that stigma with her.

**Mark:** and you guys know that I've been fully transparent about this with my own usage, obviously, but that I socialize this to my primary care physician, I tell, I, I said to my doctor, Hey, doc. There's only two things you really have to worry about in terms of my bad behavior.

**Mark:** Okay. And it's Jiu Jitsu just like Darrell at Puff Provisions, Darrell, so you know, it, there will be physical ailments, joints, like Darrell said, right there. And cannabis. I use it. It's part of my lifestyle responsibly, but those are the two things that are my risk factors. If you will go have some fun with it, go write a medicinal paper and show it off to your next conference.

**Mark:** I don't care, but I'm not gonna change. When I visit you every year, I'm gonna tell you the exact same thing and that's it. So what's my height and weight [00:25:00] and what's my blood pressure like? Thanks.

**Mike:** Just

**Mark:** you just

**Mike:** tell your

**Mark:** tell your doctor, your

**Mike:** physician you're a

**Mark:** you're a. Specimen.

**Mike:** Look at

**Mark:** Huh? Look at me. The specimen.

**Mark:** I smoke weed

**Mike:** weed and

**Mark:** and still.

**Mike:** this and function like, is that what you just told me?

**Mark:** The thing is too, you know what kind of makes it scary? There's a time, no, not scary. It's irony. It's irony. Did I tell you guys that I chose a physician that was basically 100% Catholic. So it's like I go to a Catholic physician. He has the crucifix, like with Jesus on it in every room,

**Darrell:** will use it.

**Mark:** and he's a devout, he's not, he's a, he's.

**Mark:** He's a devout Catholic and I, in every room every room has

**Mike:** In his

**Mark:** in the practice. Yeah. They're like, they're, what are those rooms called? Those are just waiting rooms. Right when you go to in each individual one. Okay. Whatever they call, I don't know the terms Whatcha talking about? Outside of the No, in like when you go to [00:26:00] e when a patient goes in the door.

**Mark:** Yeah. What are those rooms called? They just call 'em rooms or something. I don't know.

**Mike:** Exam

**Mark:** room. Okay. Each exam room has a crucifix of. Jesus, and there it is, right then and there. Three days before his resurrection.

**Mike:** On, on the

**Mark:** Yeah. On the cross. Yeah. I know in Christianity you guys don't, yeah, the ca

**Mike:** yeah,

**Mark:** in Christianity you don't have it on, you don't have him physically on there, but in Catholicism it's on there, right?

**Mark:** Darrell knows. So like in every room, I can't escape it, and he's a devout Catholic, but I liked him because his reputation was definitely. It was worth it. His from the network, the medical network that I'm in, from our insurance provider when I was touring it. And I was like, yeah, this guy's got nothing but five stars from all different age groups in all walks of life.

**Mark:** So I was like, all right, I'm choosing him. And again, I told him, I'm like, Hey, it's gonna be, I'm gonna be on this cannabis lane on this Jiu Jitsu lane for a while until someone says no. And I have Jesus looking at me the whole time, every time, turn around and cough. He's looking at me.

**Mark:** It's right then and there, but I just said, these are the things [00:27:00] that I'm gonna do. And it's funny because when you talk to a doctor, and I'm sure this is true of most doctors, you I believe that they still have a belief that, it's better to drink like a glass of red wine for your heart kind of thing or whatever that, that, yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah. I don't know if that's for real anymore or if that's just an old wives tale. 'cause I will not opt for alcohol if I could. If I could

**Darrell:** it.

**Mark:** get away with it, that's just mark. That's at Puff Provisions, Mark's personal preference. I would rather distance myself from red wine and white wine, or a beer or anything like that.

**Mark:** Of course I'll have one at a celebration. I. That's obvious, but like in general, it is not recreationally or like a medicinal thing. I put in my protocol, even though you'd say, oh, red wine one a night is good for a glass of red wine is good for your heart. Or whatever the, for your blood pressure.

**Darrell:** Side topic. I

**Darrell:** For the first time last

**Mark:** In a long time.

**Darrell:** in

**Mark:** In a long time.

**Darrell:** in a

**Mark:** Yeah. Don't say the first time you've had beer. You've had beer before.

**Darrell:** like long test and I drank, it was like a pint, right? Was that[00:28:00]

**Mark:** Okay. So a glass, just a 16 ouncer. Yeah.

**Darrell:** And God did I was like halfway. was feeling full and I was feeling

**Mark:** I hate that feeling.

**Darrell:** gross.

**Mark:** dude. I hate that feeling. Yep. And

**Darrell:** I don't

**Mark:** I don't know if it's

**Darrell:** I'm I'm getting like. Maybe because I'm older, but like I, I felt

**Mark:** I.

**Darrell:** gout coming, like you could just feel it. I'm like, oh

**Mark:** Oh my God.

**Darrell:** What

**Mark:** What would be the what were the symptoms or what did you feel after eight ounces of beer?

**Darrell:** well

**Mark:** After

**Darrell:** finished a

**Mark:** finished the glass.

**Darrell:** expensive glass of beer. But,

**Mark:** Of course. Yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah, it was like,

**Darrell:** I felt full, but I felt like sluggish and gross.

**Darrell:** Like I just, my, my fingertips were like, felt swollen.

**Mark:** I can agree with you. A similar experience. On the sluggish and gross,

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Not the finger. I did feel bloated though, like I don't like that feeling of feeling extra bloated for no reason when it's not warranted. Unless I pig out on food, then I know I did it to myself. But, if that thing [00:29:00] balloons me, I don't like it kind of thing.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** it sucks, dude. It, and then in the morning I do feel it it,

**Darrell:** Like

**Mark:** Mild hangover. Oh yeah.

**Darrell:** I

**Mark:** Oh yeah.

**Darrell:** what that is,

**Mark:** Whereas THCI don't feel it the day after.

**Darrell:** You can

**Mark:** No, you don't feel the side effect.

**Darrell:** you can

**Mark:** We didn't get there faster.

**Darrell:** Get that

**Darrell:** With smoking a joint versus drinking a beer.

**Darrell:** You need to ingest that

**Mark:** I could agree to that.

**Mark:** Agree to that, but let's let's go into the CBD territory. What's your view on that? Because we all know it's a sounding Yes. For all three of us. When we say THC, you're gonna say please. Thank you,

**Darrell:** yes.

**Mark:** but let's go with the let's go back on the other side, the variant, the cousins, the other family members of these simply just the plant?

**Mike:** so I

**Mark:** What's your

**Mike:** do have a

**Mark:** I do have a question for you guys. Sure.

**Mike:** I think we

**Mark:** I think we all know

**Mike:** my

**Mark:** my current

**Mike:** it,

**Mark:** it.

**Mike:** but I

**Mark:** Absolutely.

**Mark:** I wonder,

**Mike:** hear

**Mark:** I wanna hear it from the pro CBD guys.

**Mark:** Okay. What's the question?

**Mike:** so it

**Mark:** [00:30:00] So it sounds like you're okay with taking it for yourself, recommendation for yourself if

**Mike:** go.

**Mark:** to go. If it was a older loved one

**Mike:** of

**Mark:** right of age, of adult age.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mike:** Out

**Mark:** try out CBD.

**Mike:** Stuff.

**Mark:** stuff.

**Mike:** If your

**Mark:** If your kid, okay. Say for instance,

**Mike:** a

**Mark:** had

**Mark:** A really bad teeth, or

**Mike:** some minor

**Mark:** minor pain. Localized pain. Okay. Yeah, let's go. Traditional pains. Dental. Yeah. Threatening or.

**Mike:** anything

**Mark:** Anything.

**Mike:** where you have

**Mark:** Yeah. Or you have to go to the doctor

**Mike:** that, it's

**Mark:** that it's just life

**Mike:** yes, you'll

**Mark:** Makes sense.

**Mike:** dental,

**Mark:** Yeah dental makes sense. That's com a common problem for kids. You'll wait

**Mike:** the

**Mark:** to see the doctor on

**Mike:** morning,

**Mark:** Uhhuh,

**Mike:** but for right

**Mark:** but for right now, they're on the brink of,

**Mike:** can't

**Mark:** sleep.

**Mark:** Because it hurts. This is a good one.

**Mike:** them,

**Mark:** would give, typically you would give them, some kids towel, right?

**Mark:** Some, yeah.

**Mark:** Oh, yep.

**Mike:** pain until we can

**Mark:** Until we can get to the doctor.

**Mike:** tomorrow.

**Mark:** Yep. Overnight. Overnight versus you guarantee. Yep. Typically you have that in the house, but say for instance, you ran

**Mike:** You're going to

**Mark:** okay. Get Tylenol,

**Mike:** or you're going to get

**Mark:** get [00:31:00] some

**Mike:** CCBD

**Mark:** CBD friendly,

**Mike:** friendly

**Mark:** kid friendly stuff,

**Mark:** Say, I'm sure it's out there, maybe it's out there.

**Mark:** Maybe CBD kid friendly solutions like kid.

**Mike:** C, B,

**Mark:** Kid. C, B, D.

**Mike:** Gummy

**Mark:** gummy form.

**Mike:** They could take the

**Mark:** They could take the CBD or could it be in a drop form? Because if they can't chew, 'cause it's a dental pain, they can't chew. Probably. Yeah. Oh yeah, exactly.

**Mike:** Or like

**Mark:** So a gummy wouldn't even work.

**Mike:** like that.

**Mark:** A syrup or something. A syrup. Okay.

**Mark:** There you go. A syrup.

**Mike:** A syrup. You

**Mark:** Syrup, you put it in the little cup.

**Mike:** Five

**Mark:** Five milligrams of CBD.

**Mike:** They take it.

**Mark:** They take it to be honest.

**Mike:** are you guys gonna get

**Mark:** Gonna get the CV

**Mike:** Ah,

**Mark:** to be hon.

**Mike:** the, okay. Kids.

**Mark:** To be honest.

**Mike:** The people you truly love, you don't care about. You don't care about empty bang,

**Mark:** Bang, auntie bang, can handle it until the next morning. I don't know if I want to hear.

**Mike:** Waste your

**Mark:** I don't know if I want to hear. I don't know if I wanna hear my kids crying for 12 hours. [00:32:00] 'cause daddy needs sleep too. Okay.

**Mike:** getting

**Mark:** You getting the CB, you getting them C BD or you getting,

**Mike:** them Tylenol?

**Mark:** so do I go to the,

**Mike:** have to go to

**Mark:** okay, but the situa the situation.

**Mark:** You've already framed the problem in that I don't have access to Tylenol. You've, that's how you frame the problem. You have to go to the store.

**Mike:** you have to go to the

**Mark:** You have to go to store for.

**Mike:** you know

**Mark:** Okay. And both are in stock.

**Mike:** Yes, both

**Mark:** in stock. Both are in stock, okay? So I'm gonna rock in a, I'm gonna rock in a hard place when I'm at the retailer to decide if I choose left or if I choose right?

**Mark:** That's what you're telling me.

**Mike:** Are you?

**Mark:** Ah,

**Mike:** I don't think you're gonna

**Mark:** I don't think you'd get both. Why would you do both? That's true. You are cornering me. Hold on.

**Mike:** You're not

**Mark:** You're not gonna

**Mike:** your

**Mark:** drug your talent. No, I'm not.

**Mike:** So you either

**Mark:** So you either get a towel in the hall

**Mike:** or CB,

**Mark:** or CD

**Mike:** 'cause they're right

**Mark:** because they're right next to you.

**Mike:** Or an

**Mark:** You wanna go firsty?

**Mike:** owl

**Mark:** You wanna go Firstie or should I?

**Darrell:** You can go

**Mark:** you can go. Okay. This is one where I know I defer to Mike on this one because I would go for Tylenol first because [00:33:00] I would go for what I know. That being said, if that being said stop. That being said, I would buy both from the counter.

**Mark:** I would. And I would try it on me first.

**Mike:** Wait. What?

**Mark:** Wait, what?

**Mike:** It's baby

**Mark:** baby

**Mike:** D.

**Mark:** D.

**Mike:** You just

**Mark:** You just

**Mike:** a,

**Mark:** showed me a,

**Mark:** So you just showed

**Mike:** The

**Mark:** the world

**Mike:** that you

**Mark:** that you had a

**Mike:** Dizzy

**Mark:** dizzy C, b, D tip. Adult size.

**Mike:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mike:** So

**Mark:** Kid's, not the kid's. Protocol is never gonna be in a vape form. Come on. I know where you're going with this

**Mike:** the

**Mark:** test. The CBD

**Mike:** For what?

**Mark:** what?

**Mark:** Shit. Yeah. How would I do that? For what? How would I do that? You bring up a good point. This is very, this is, no, I don't believe it's poison at all. Yeah. I don't believe it's poison at all, but this is a very good one. This is [00:34:00] a very, it's like how much do you, yeah. You go with what you know and how much what you

**Darrell:** trust.

**Mark:** Like, how much do you want to advocate for? How much do you wanna advocate for this Mark? That's what it's asking me.

**Darrell:** Advil and

**Mark:** Yeah. They have

**Darrell:** They've been around for

**Mark:** been around for so long, they

**Darrell:** Data on what happens. Long-term effects,

**Mark:** for sure. You know what's,

**Darrell:** know what's

**Mark:** you know what's gonna happen.

**Darrell:** take Tylenol

**Mark:** I totally,

**Darrell:** it's not into, its,

**Mark:** The depth of knowledge isn't there quite yet. It's not mature yet, right? Yeah. It.

**Darrell:** mature in this space. So of course there's not,

**Mark:** There's no

**Darrell:** data like that.

**Mark:** true and it's a big disservice. It's a big disservice to them,

**Darrell:** year forecast of what CBG will do to whatever it

**Mark:** whatever.

**Darrell:** your body. What if it

**Mike:** Say

**Mark:** So say for instance, Tylenol is

**Mike:** is safe,

**Mark:** safe,

**Mike:** but c,

**Mark:** but C, b, D,

**Mike:** since

**Mark:** since it's

**Mike:** its

**Mark:** in its infancy Yeah.

**Darrell:** Yeah,

**Mike:** don't

**Mark:** We don't know that

**Mike:** in

**Mark:** if in 30 years it'll give us

**Darrell:** exactly.

**Mark:** That's true.

**Darrell:** a report

**Mark:** Which I highly doubt. Still. I highly doubt. But still you need to prove it with data.

**Mike:** though. It

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mike:** you guys

**Mark:** Yeah. So that's like a pi.

**Mike:** to your

**Mark:** There's a residual.

**Darrell:** [00:35:00] I

**Mark:** There's a residual, yeah. I wouldn't waste money. Money like Mark and go fucking Fisher-Price.

**Darrell:** oh, take a one drop. Oh. Makes, it hurts my chest. Oh, I'm not giving this to the kids. Nope.

**Mark:** Okay, so this really,

**Darrell:** it.

**Mark:** This tests me because. Okay, let's get really analytical about it. As much as I could be a proponent of children's Tylenol, which I am, because we all know in this room

**Mike:** It works. It

**Mark:** It works. But that's still isn't that taxing to a human body's liver, if you overdo it.

**Mark:** Okay. So we know that's a side effect. So that's something you have to be willing to embrace. But again, the data is proven.

**Darrell:** yeah,

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Darrell:** data. Not concrete, but it's data

**Mark:** it's enough consistent data to show the side effects or the what data.

**Darrell:** On the other side of that column, right?

**Mark:** Yeah. Fucking schedule one ruins everything.

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah. Maybe there is some

**Darrell:** some guy did it and then you know, he's just waiting to release the

**Mark:** data.

**Mark:** No, you guys know behind the scenes of the Puff revisions. [00:36:00] Curtain that I've been studying this stuff on a more pragmatic academic scale, specifically cultivation and harvesting kind of thing. What

**Darrell:** He

**Mark:** he loves it so much, Mike. He went to school.

**Darrell:** it.

**Mark:** Yeah, so but you got taught this stuff.

**Mark:** You got taught

**Darrell:** dork.

**Mike:** Yeah. Fricking dork.

**Mark:** you got taught this stuff. It was pretty cool, dude. It was pretty fucking cool. The education. I the, if you guys haven't seen Yep. Just keep checking out the newsletter that gets announced every Thursday on our, mainly our Instagram as of late. And you'll know what I mean. These guys know what I'm talking about.

**Mark:** Back

**Darrell:** see

**Mark:** see

**Darrell:** like trees in

**Mark:** in your backyard.

**Darrell:** Just

**Mark:** One day. One day, one day. You gotta start small though, and dude it like a cornfield.

**Darrell:** like a cornfield.

**Mark:** Yeah, dude. Cultivation is actually very, it's a very P, it's a very, it's art and science all in one

**Mark:** And everyone can down, right? [00:37:00] Yeah.

**Darrell:** have

**Mark:** You have infinite. My biggest fear, and I know we're deviating quite a bit, and now that we're talking about the cultivation in horticulture and harvesting and agriculture kind of part, but really, if I could give you guys a common pain point, probably about it.

**Mark:** Is nutrient deficiency and pest management is a big issue. If you don't have mastery of how to counteract those techniques, it's game over for your crop and a waste of time.

**Darrell:** I'm curious

**Mark:** I'm curious what pe

**Darrell:** is there?

**Mark:** Everything.

**Darrell:** or

**Mark:** Caterpillar or something. Yeah. You'd be surprised how many freaking like

**Darrell:** that's

**Mark:** ver vermin, believe it or not, it's just a freaking plant.

**Mark:** Just like anything. It's a plant and they attract.

**Darrell:** in the back and I have to

**Mark:** And I bet you there's,

**Darrell:** a time.

**Mark:** I bet you there are pests on that, that are like doing negative things. Yeah. And caterpillars eat the leaves and stuff like that. So you gotta have your soil in order. The nutrients, what in there? Anything [00:38:00] contacting the plant that, you know, the plant fucking itself up by growing in whatever way you gotta,

**Darrell:** growing and then

**Mark:** yeah.

**Darrell:** decides, Hey, you're tasty.

**Mark:** Some fan leaves. Some fan leaves aren't getting enough sun and stuff like that. The next thing you know, those leaves are like yellowing out and you're just like, shit, what the hell? And then you cut them and then still your plant's like dying and then you're like, oh shoot. Is it a nutrient deficiency?

**Mark:** Then you go through this rabbit hole of of trial and error and it's just wow, I respect the cultivators that put our CB, D and THC to our homes, to our plates. So you gotta respect that craft because it's gonna be, and. I deviate it yet again. But product development, making new things outside of the things we traditionally know flower, everyone knows flower because that's how it was conventionally shown to us.

**Mark:** But, the vape cartridges that I see here, dap like dabbing or something, whatever the case may be tinctures and stuff like that. And other ways are it's pretty gnarly and crazy stuff. But again, back on the track of the CBD thing where was I going with this? With the [00:39:00] CBD. I'm not even a Hi tonight, boys.

**Darrell:** wow.

**Mark:** Oh, wow. No, I wanted to have, this one's a special one because it's good. Shut up.

**Darrell:** Yeah. Ooh.

**Mark:** Oh, dude. It was good. This was a good one that Mike cornered us with because

**Mike:** Yeah, you

**Mark:** true. This is I don't wanna be

**Darrell:** because

**Mark:** Exactly,

**Darrell:** trusted,

**Mark:** it.

**Darrell:** proven.

**Mark:** will not be a hypocrite at all to where I currently stand on what I know.

**Mark:** Is effective, if you will. That's why I'm saying though, that I'm not knocking the idea and I would like to buy both, but I gotta figure out I gotta read the box. It's really what that's about. If I don't make that effort to read the box, then I did a disservice.

**Mike:** on that,

**Mark:** What do you mean? Oh, no I knew I chose that was like one of my that was one of my things.

**Mark:** I, I buy all my stuff on March and Ash online now.

**Mike:** You're saying it's

**Mark:** I read it.

**Mike:** D,

**Mark:** You're saying

**Mike:** the

**Mark:** the product

**Mike:** for the

**Mark:** for the child. Yeah, that's the product for the child. And how you not how you designed it. I don't care how pretty the box looks. I care about the information or the facts on there and what you [00:40:00] aimed for it to do thing.

**Mark:** So I have to make a real effort there before I make that final decision. Am I knocking it or frowning upon it? No. That's why I'm saying, Mike, I would like to take both. I would buy both, but yeah, for sure. I'm not gonna be a hypocrite. I'm gonna tell you the truth that I defer to Tylenol first. I would because to be more selfish about it.

**Mark:** Honestly, like I said before, daddy needs to sleep, so y'all need to go to bed. I ain't dealing with this. I ain't dealing with this until tomorrow morning. So take your 10 milliliters and it's a tomorrow problem. It's future daddy's problem. Not tonight daddy's problem kind of thing. But you gotta gimme a little bit of leeway and say, I'm gonna buy both.

**Mark:** F even though you know I'm going to do the first one. You got anything else to add to that? Dee? That was a good one. I, that was a good one. That tests my advocacy, that tests everything, which is what I'm here to do.

**Darrell:** So speaking of CBD for [00:41:00] medical,

**Mark:** Okay. For medical medicinal reasons. Okay.

**Darrell:** So

**Mark:** you use it for recreational? That doesn't make sense.

**Darrell:** my my sister-in-law's dog needed ACL surgery,

**Mark:** Really

**Darrell:** right?

**Mark:** like a real ACL surgery. Yeah.

**Darrell:** dogs

**Mark:** geez.

**Darrell:** just like us, right?

**Mark:** I didn't know that.

**Mark:** Not a king, not an expert in this. Okay.

**Darrell:** from running everywhere because when they take him to wherever he likes to just, he has the zoomies and he'll just like dart off. but I guess one time they did that and he came back limping and then he was like wincing the entire time after that. But,

**Mark:** Oh shoot. Like you could visibly see the canine wincing, like

**Darrell:** Yeah. Like

**Mark:** and all that shit.

**Darrell:** weight on that leg at all.

**Mark:** Oh, damn.

**Darrell:** so we took, they took him to the hospital or to the vet, and out he, he has a small tear in his a CLI think

**Mark:** Oh shit.

**Darrell:** injuries, but I know it was

**Mark:** I know.

**Darrell:** the dog's ACL, it's not

**Mark:** It's not even acl.

**Darrell:** it's the dog version of an ACL.

**Mark:** [00:42:00] See, that's why I'd ask. I was like, dogs have acls.

**Darrell:** They, it's

**Mark:** It's similar to what

**Darrell:** would be,

**Mark:** would be, okay,

**Darrell:** for dog form, so

**Mark:** gotcha. Anyway,

**Darrell:** so dog had

**Mark:** so doctor procedure has like

**Mark:** Professional,

**Darrell:** basketball player, ACL surgery.

**Mark:** would you call it a procedure or would you call it a surgery? Yeah, I know. Hospitals have a way of selling. Selling the service to you. Is it a procedure or is it a surgery different?

**Mark:** That's a good question.

**Darrell:** know, but based off what I remember, I think they were referring to it as a procedure, so maybe it

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** a procedure.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Darrell:** Anyway, so

**Mark:** So

**Darrell:** got

**Mark:** keep going. I derailed you my bad. One of the,

**Darrell:** so they gave prescription drugs for post-surgery or

**Darrell:** It was, some painkillers, some like Tylenol

**Mark:** 800 milligrams of Tylenol from Uncle Mike. Yeah.

**Darrell:** Yeah. Or,

**Mark:** APA revisions, Mike.

**Darrell:** so like that, and like ointment, so the shift doesn't get infected. And then they gave him what's it called? Like C, BD drops.

**Mark:** Okay. C, b, D drops for a canine. Interesting. We were like

**Darrell:** [00:43:00] I'm, I don't

**Mark:** I don't have a pet, by the way. This is why I'm playing ignorant. 'cause I don't have a, I don't have a pet, I think. Yeah.

**Darrell:** I think that CBD was a recommendation from the doctor. Like you said if you want, if he needs more the prescribed painkillers aren't helping him,

**Darrell:** Then give him some C, B, D and so that's, it was

**Mark:** it was

**Darrell:** and that's

**Mark:** that's been the theme.

**Darrell:** of all my stories is like, it is that it's c, b, D accompanied by something else. So when I do stuff for my stuff, it's C, b, D, then some fucking Tylenol, right? And

**Mark:** And you know what? I'm not even against that. I'm not against that. 'cause I would probably pair it the same way.

**Darrell:** It, it only takes me so far where like any Tylenol to really get to that spot. So

**Mark:** Yeah. Anyway,

**Darrell:** so they

**Mark:** so they

**Darrell:** they gave the dog CBD one day. And the thing with the dog is when you bring the doorbell, he goes nuts.

**Darrell:** Like some, like someone's gonna break in and he needs to fight him, right? But the minute he was on the CBD, he

**Mark:** he was quiet.

**Darrell:** He was like,

**Mark:** Oh.

**Darrell:** and he

**Mark:** And he was like.

**Darrell:** out. Like I was like, is he okay? [00:44:00] But he was

**Mark:** He was just like really chill

**Darrell:** Doorbell

**Mark:** doorbell, like

**Darrell:** anything,

**Mark:** anything like notifications on phone.

**Darrell:** start barking. And

**Mark:** Okay. So he is still sensitive. The dog's still sensitive?

**Darrell:** but maybe because a dog, it gives a dog anxiety or something, I don't know.

**Darrell:** The way

**Mark:** okay.

**Darrell:** CBD,

**Darrell:** Super calm. He was like mellow. He would just sit on the couch and he was just like, ah, I'm okay.

**Mark:** Is he is the, at the time of this recording, is the dog still on these protocols?

**Darrell:** don't think

**Mark:** I don't think so anymore. Okay. Okay.

**Darrell:** Actually

**Mark:** Actually,

**Darrell:** I, they

**Mark:** they actually have to

**Darrell:** him

**Mark:** take them.

**Darrell:** another procedure because he tore his

**Mark:** What the hell? What the hell? How do you tear the other ACL when you can't even,

**Darrell:** he's a I, let's

**Mark:** I don't get that.

**Darrell:** runner and I guess he, he messed

**Mark:** All.

**Darrell:** But yeah. Anyway, that's my story.

**Mark:** So thematically, the common thing from ATP Puff Provisions Darrell's world is that he pairs the two it all, something else always [00:45:00] follows. The CBD

**Darrell:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Mike's is definitely, I did not think of C, b, D at all to cure my ailment, which was

**Mike:** bit.

**Mark:** hyper extended or a strained calf or something stretchy in the back of the leg.

**Mark:** And for me, I, for me, I am also in my own way saying that I put a priority on what I know first versus what isn't known at the time. So that is the honest to gosh truth at the year 2025 for episode 58, CBD for the family. And that is fine. That is not something probably someone that makes CBD wants to hear, but they should hear it nonetheless because this is the truth.

**Mark:** Are you talking about three dads and. We got a lot of different responsibilities and a lot of unknowns and life is moving really fast all the time kind of mentality. But I still wanna order it, Mike, like I said, like I will put it, I will put it in the medicinal side of the pantry. We've got our children's Tylenol, [00:46:00] we've got our, what's the other one you have to flip between the two?

**Mark:** If you have a persistent fever for children. Motrin, right? You have Motrin, so pivot between the two so you don't tax the liver or something like that, right? Something like that. And then it's gonna be right there, uncle Mike's kid's, c, BD. It literally says on the box, uncle Mike's, c, BD, on the box, gummy bear, flavored, and I'm gonna have it there too. But now it's just a matter of like when and what is appropriate for that kind of mentality. But see the other things too, Darrell, is your story is, describe big extremes like, cancer care, basically your bone getting ripped off of your foot, or your ligament getting ripped off of a foot for a canine.

**Mark:** Those are extremes. I, okay, Mike, I'll count yours. Two as an extreme. Pulling a cap, never having an injury in your life, never having an injury in your life, right? That was the truth.

**Mike:** Yeah,

**Mark:** you had this and it was legitimate pain.

**Mike:** a Hemi. I had a Hemi and, but this was.

**Mark:** No, [00:47:00] but which would, this is compare this one was bad versus those, right? Comparatively. Yeah. Speaking. Okay.

**Mike:** yeah,

**Mark:** which forced you to self-diagnose with Google? So you know, these are the three different unique perspectives we're bringing to note. And I wanted to bring that up to the plate kind of thing.

**Mark:** 'cause it's important. 'cause that's where we are. Eight, nine years later, after Prop 64 got legalized, has it been nine years? What year is this? 2025. All right. Oh shit. It's been nine years since Prop 64, so there you go.

**Mike:** Yeah. The

**Mark:** Time went by fast for nine years. I am. Yep. And that origin story will resurface that yet again at a different kind of episode, at a different time and place.

**Mark:** But

**Darrell:** it's a

**Mark:** gentlemen, do you wanna take anything else off your chest before we kindly depart for tonight's inaugural episode of the Puff Provisions Podcast in year 2025? Did I leave anything out?

**Darrell:** It removes stains off the carpet pretty well. If you like rub it, dab it. Like

**Mike:** [00:48:00] Grout

**Mark:** Okay. Okay. Okay.

**Mike:** and

**Darrell:** Just

**Mark:** Okay.

**Mark:** Soaks right in. Okay. There you go. Lift

**Mike:** right

**Mark:** dirt right off. There you go.

**Darrell:** it

**Mark:** It never was there. There you go. You know I did when that obviously circa nine years ago when CBD came out everywhere from. To every grocer out there, like Sprouts and whatnot,

**Darrell:** Remember

**Mark:** Yeah. The price was ridiculous for a tiny little jar.

**Mark:** I'm like, fucking eight 80 to 120 bucks. I was like, what the fuck? Fuck this. Yeah. That initially, and that's the price 0.9 years ago. I don't know what it is now, by the way. I don't know. I,

**Mike:** a lot cheaper.

**Mark:** yeah I'd hope so. I'd hope so.

**Darrell:** to cigarettes.

**Mark:** Hey, I quit cigarettes a long time ago. No. No, I quit that habit well over early millennium, early millennial.

**Mark:** I forget when it's been over 20 years. Yeah. I'm at peace with that decision and I don't want to go back tobacco free. Oh, yeah. But no I don't think I overlooked [00:49:00] anything. This was, I wanted to uproot some truth to this because it's important. 'cause it exposes a lot of. Stuff that still needs to be done for that side of the, that subset of cannabis if you will.

**Mark:** So nine years later, after Prop 64, this is where we're at. And it's not a knock to the, to anybody that makes that stuff to the brands out there that, that make it. It's just you need more, as a consumer, we need more understanding and that's what it is.

**Mike:** And

**Mark:** So no one needs diet? No. No.

**Darrell:** diet weed.

**Mark:** No. I to be fair.

**Mark:** To be fair, maybe, shit, I don't have one. No, there's no punchline. There's no gotcha. You're right. There's none. There's Puff Provisions, Darrell at Puff Provisions.
